    abstract = { The International H2O Project (IHOP\_2002) is one of the largest North American meteorological field experiments in history. From 13 May to 25 June 2002, over 250 researchers and technical staff from the United States, Germany, France, and Canada converged on the Southern Great Plains to measure water vapor and other atmospheric variables. The principal objective of IHOP\_2002 is to obtain an improved characterization of the time-varying three-dimensional water vapor field and evaluate its utility in improving the understanding and prediction of convective processes. The motivation for this objective is the combination of extremely low forecast skill for warm-season rainfall and the relatively large loss of life and property from flash floods and other warm-season weather hazards. Many prior studies on convective storm forecasting have shown that water vapor is a key atmospheric variable that is insufficiently measured. Toward this goal, IHOP\_2002 brought together many of the existing operational and new state-of-the-art research water vapor sensors and numerical models. The IHOP\_2002 experiment comprised numerous unique aspects. These included several instruments fielded for the first time (e.g., reference radiosonde); numerous upgraded instruments (e.g., Wyoming Cloud Radar); the first ever horizontal-pointing water vapor differential absorption lidar (DIAL; i.e., Leandre II on the Naval Research Laboratory P-3), which required the first onboard aircraft avoidance radar; several unique combinations of sensors (e.g., multiple profiling instruments at one field site and the German water vapor DIAL and NOAA/Environmental Technology Laboratory Doppler lidar on board the German Falcon aircraft); and many logistical challenges. This article presents a summary of the motivation, goals, and experimental design of the project, illustrates some preliminary data collected, and includes discussion on some potential operational and research implications of the experiment. }

    abstract = { Abstract Flash flooding represents a significant hazard to human safety and a threat to property. Simulation and prediction of floods in complex urban settings requires high-resolution precipitation estimates and distributed hydrologic modeling. The need for reliable flash flood forecasting has increased in recent years, especially in urban communities, because of the high costs associated with flood occurrences. Several storm nowcast systems use radar to provide quantitative precipitation forecasts that can potentially afford great benefits to flood warning and short-term forecasting in urban settings. In this paper, the potential benefits of high-resolution weather radar data, physically based distributed hydrologic modeling, and quantitative precipitation nowcasting for urban hydrology and flash flood prediction were demonstrated by forcing a physically based distributed hydrologic model with precipitation forecasts made by a convective storm nowcast system to predict flash floods in a small, highly urbanized catchment in Denver, Colorado. Two rainfall events on 5 and 8 July 2001 in the Harvard Gulch watershed are presented that correspond to times during which the storm nowcast system was operated. Results clearly indicate that high-resolution radar-rainfall estimates and advanced nowcasting can potentially lead to improvements in flood warning and forecasting in urban watersheds, even for short-lived events on small catchments. At lead times of 70 min before the occurrence of peak discharge, forecast accuracies of approximately 17\% in peak discharge and 10 min in peak timing were achieved for a 10 km2 highly urbanized catchment. }

Abstract = {{In Mediterranean Europe, flash flooding is one of the most devastating
   hazards in terms of loss of human life and infrastructures. Over the
   last two decades, flash floods have caused damage costing a billion
   Euros in France alone. One of the problems of flash floods is that
   warning times are very short, leaving typically only a few hours for
   civil protection services to act. This study investigates if
   operationally available short-range numerical weather forecasts together
   with a rainfall-runoff model can be used for early indication of the
   occurrence of flash floods.
   One of the challenges in flash flood forecasting is that the watersheds
   are typically small, and good observational networks of both rainfall
   and discharge are rare. Therefore, hydrological models are difficult to
   calibrate and the simulated river discharges cannot always be compared
   with ground measurements. The lack of observations in most flash flood
   prone basins, therefore, necessitates the development of a method where
   the excess of the simulated discharge above a critical threshold can
   provide the forecaster with an indication of potential flood hazard in
   the area, with lead times of the order of weather forecasts.
   This study is focused on the Cevennes-Vivarais region in the Southeast
   of the Massif Central in France, a region known for devastating flash
   floods. This paper describes the main aspects of using numerical weather
   forecasting for flash flood forecasting, together with a threshold -
   exceedance. As a case study the severe flash flood event which took
   place on 8 - 9 September 2002 has been chosen.
   Short-range weather forecasts, from the Lokalmodell of the German
   national weather service, are used as input for the LISFLOOD model, a
   hybrid between a conceptual and physically based rainfall-runoff model.
   Results of the study indicate that high resolution operational weather
   forecasting combined with a rainfall-runoff model could be useful to
   determine flash floods more than 24 h in advance.}},

Abstract = {{Every year floods cause enormous damage all over the world. This study
   investigates loss of human life statistics for different types of floods
   and different regions on a global scale. The OFDA/CRED Database contains
   data on international disasters and is maintained by the Centre for
   Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters in Brussels (CRED) in
   cooperation with United States Office for Foreign Disaster Assistance
   (OFDA). Information from this source on a large number of flood events,
   which occurred between January 1975 and June 2002, is evaluated with
   respect to flood location and flood type. Due to the limited
   availability of information on coastal flood events, the scope of this
   study is limited to three types of freshwater flooding; river floods,
   flash floods and drainage problems. First, the development of loss of
   life statistics over time is discussed. Second, the dataset is analysed
   by region, by flood type and by the combination of type and region. The
   study shows that flash floods result in the highest average mortality
   per event (the number of fatalities divided by the number of affected
   persons). A cross analysis by flood type and location shows that average
   mortality is relatively constant for the different types over various
   continents, while the magnitude of the impacts (numbers of killed) and
   affected for a certain type varies between the different continents. On
   a worldwide scale Asian river floods are most significant in terms of
   number of persons killed and affected. Finally, a comparison with
   figures for other types of natural disasters shows that floods are the
   most significant disaster type in terms of the number of persons
   affected.}},

abstract = {The 1962 Rub{\'{i}} flood was a severe flash flood, the worst to ever take place in Spain, claiming the lives of more than 800 people following 200 mm of rainfall in 2 h. Such a high number of casualties can be explained by the very high vulnerability of people who lived in the floodplains of a wandering, ephemeral stream (a wadi) prone to flash floods. Many publications to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the flood have been used as proxy data for the event, especially in terms of social aspects. The meteorological and pluviometric information is reviewed, while other information is only found in grey literature. Recently, the event has been considered an outlier in the panorama of European flash floods. Because of the above, this paper aims to convey all the information to readers and show that it deserves to be raised to an international level as an example of an extreme flash flood. After addressing some misunderstandings, it can be concluded that the event was not an outlier, nor was it extreme, in terms of total rainfall, return period, discharge, discharge per unit basin area, unit stream power and flow velocity. It may be extraordinary because the flood reached very high levels by transporting large amounts of both fine and coarse sediment particles. The stream is steep, ephemeral, lacking an armour layer, and prone to torrential events, in which the large sediment transport played a role in how high the flood levels rose. The use of flooding marks to compute discharges is also discussed. In addition, the paper presents a torrential calculation based on the momentum principle in a control volume.},

Prediction of occurrence of flash flood locations is very difficult due to sudden change in climatic condition and manmade factors. However, prior identification of flood susceptible areas can be done with the help of machine learning techniques for proper timely management of flood hazards. In this study, we tested four decision trees based machine learning models namely Logistic Model Trees (LMT), Reduced Error Pruning Trees (REPT), Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes Trees (NBT), and Alternating Decision Trees (ADT) for flash flood susceptibility mapping at the Haraz Watershed in the northern part of Iran. For this, a spatial database was constructed with 201 present and past flood locations and eleven flood-influencing factors namely ground slope, altitude, curvature, Stream Power Index (SPI), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), land use, rainfall, river density, distance from river, lithology, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Statistical evaluation measures, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, and Freidman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to validate and compare the prediction capability of the models. Results show that the ADT model has the highest prediction capability for flash flood susceptibility assessment, followed by the NBT, the LMT, and the REPT, respectively. These techniques have proven successful in quickly determining flood susceptible areas.},

Flash flood disaster is a major problem in the state due to its diverse topography combined with meteorological and morphological conditions. In the present study, detailed terrain information was used to identify the causes of natural disaster. Remote Sensing data such as Landsat 8 satellite data and ASTER (DEM) coupled with geological and geomorphological data were utilized in a Geographical Information System (GIS) environment for the estimation of flash flood risk in 20 sub-watersheds of Beas valley. Morphometric analysis was used to estimate the flash flood risk levels of sub-watersheds. Drainage characteristics, slope, and wetness index were analyzed by a set of parameters relevant to flash flood risks. All the sub-watersheds were assigned with a rank according to the compound value analyzed for all the given parameters. After analysis of compound values, it was observed that an area of 555 km2which is 47{\%} of the total area was in very high priority and very highly susceptible to the flash flood occurrences. In the entire watershed, more than 90{\%} of the total area was found to be highly vulnerable to flash floods. Such zonations using RS/GIS can assist policymakers in taking appropriate and timely measures for the reduction of flash floods. This can initiate appropriate corrective measures and reduce the risk of heavy loss of life and property.},

@article{Marchi2016,
abstract = {Flash floods are characterized by strong spatial gradients of rainfall inputs that hit different parts of a river basin with different intensity. Stream power values associated with flash floods therefore show spatial variations that depend on geological controls on channel geometry and sediment characteristics, as well as on the variations of flood intensity: this stresses the need for a field approach that takes into account the variability of the controlling factors. Post-flood assessment of peak discharge after major floods makes it possible to analyse stream power in fluvial systems affected by flash floods. This study analyses the stream power of seven intense (return period of rainfall {\textgreater} 100 years at least in some sectors of the river basin) flash floods that occurred in mountainous basins of central and southern Europe from 2007 to 2014. In most of the analysed cross sections, high values of unit stream power were observed; this is consistent with the high severity of the studied floods. The highest values of cross-sectional stream power and unit stream power usually occur in Mediterranean regions. This is mainly ascribed to the larger peak discharges that characterize flash floods in these regions. The variability of unit stream power with catchment area is clearly nonlinear and has been represented by log-quadratic relations. The values of catchment area at which maximum values of unit stream power occur show relevant differences among the studied floods and are linked to the spatial scale of the events. Values of stream power are generally consistent with observed geomorphic changes in the studied cross sections: bedrock channels show the highest values of unit stream power but no visible erosion, whereas major erosion has been observed in alluvial channels. Exceptions to this general pattern, which mostly occur in semi-alluvial cross sections, urge the recognition of local or event-specific conditions that increase the resistance of channel bed and banks to erosion or, like short flow duration, reduce the geomorphic effectiveness of the flood.},
