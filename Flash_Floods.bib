Lloró (5°30′N, 76°32′W, 120m) has received above 12,700 mm (1952–1960). Using the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data, we show that the ocean-land-atmosphere interaction over the easternmost fringe of the tropical Pacific, enhanced by the dynamics of a low-level westerly jet (“CHOCO”), contributes to explain the existence of such record-breaking hydrological region. Deep convection develops from low-level moisture convergence by the CHOCO jet, combined with high-level easterly trade winds, orographic lifting on the western Andes, low surface pressures and warm air. Precipitation is organized in mesoscale convective complexes, in turn dynamically linked to the jet. The strength of the CHOCO jet (centered at 5°N) is associated with the gradient of surface air temperatures between western Colombia and the Niño 1+2 region, thereby exhibiting strong annual and interannual variability, which contributes to explaining Colombia's hydro-climatology and its anomalies during ENSO.}

    abstract = { Abstract One of the rainiest areas on earth, the Panama Bight and Pacific (western) littoral of Colombia, is the focal point for a regional modeling study utilizing the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University–NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) with nested grids. In this first of three parts, the observed climatology of the region is presented. The seasonal march of rainfall has a northwest–southeast axis, with western Colombia near the center, receiving rain throughout the year. This study focuses on the August–September season. The diurnal cycle of rainfall over land exhibits an afternoon maximum over most of South and Central America, typically composed of relatively small convective cloud systems. Over some large valleys in the Andes, and over Lake Maracaibo, a nocturnal maximum of rainfall is observed. A strong night/morning maximum of rainfall prevails over the coastal ocean, propagating offshore and westward with time. This offshore convection often takes the form of mesoscale convective systems with sizes comparable to the region's coastal concavities and other geographical features. The 10-day period of these model studies (28 August–7 September 1998) is shown to be a period of unusually active weather, but with a time-mean rainfall pattern similar to longer-term climatology. It is concluded that the rain-producing processes during this time period are likely to be typical of those that shape the seasonal climatology. }

abstract = {Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) have regions of both convective and stratiform precipitation, and they develop mesoscale circulations as they mature. The upward motion takes the form of a deep-layer ascent drawn into the MCS in response to the latent heating and cooling in the convective region. The ascending layer overturns as it rises but overall retains a coherent layer structure. A middle level layer of inflow enters the stratiform region of the MCS from a direction determined by the large-scale flow and descends in response to diabatic cooling at middle-to-low levels. A middle level mesoscale convective vortex (MCV) develops in the stratiform region, prolongs the MCS, and may contribute to tropical cyclone development. The propagation of an MCS may have a discrete component but may further be influenced by waves and disturbances generated both in response to the MCS and external to the MCS. Waves of a larger scale may affect the propagation velocity by phase locking with the MCS in a cooperative mode. The horizontal scale of an MCS may be limited either by a balance between the formation rate of convective precipitation and dissipation of stratiform precipitation or by the Rossby radius of the MCV. The vertical redistribution of momentum by an MCS depends on the size of the stratiform region, while the net vertical profile of heating of the large-scale environment depends on the amount of stratiform rain. Regional variability of the stratiform rain from MCSs affects the large-scale circulation's response to MCS heating.}

abstract = {Small mountain streams are typically affected by the same variables as larger counterparts, but small headwater channels are also coupled with hillslopes. The added degree of system complexity limits extension of existing conceptual and quantitative models of stream response to small mountain streams. Our objective is to determine how the presence of multiple lithologies on channel beds and coarse sediments affect relationships between channel geometry and driving and resisting variables in small mountain streams when the variables are examined at the landscape-scale. We test for systematic scaling of channel geometry, stream power indices, and median bed grain size (D50) in headwater streams draining {\textless} 10 km2and overlying multiple strata on a passive continental margin. Field data were collected from 157 reaches in 32 watersheds. Local strata can be divided into a thick sequence of resistant sandstones and a thick sequence of low resistance, calcareous siltstones and shales with interbedded limestones. Both stratigraphic units are present in every watershed and all streams carry abundant, coarse bed load derived from the resistant unit. Mean widths and gradients of the channels are correlated with upstream drainage area. Unit stream power is not statistically different as a function of rock unit, but channel gradients are lower atop the low resistance unit. D50is not correlated with drainage area, but is positively correlated with unit stream power. The correlation between unit stream power and D50is evidence for mutual adjustments among gradients, widths, and D50as a function of the primary driving force in the drainage area, discharge. The small effect of bed lithology on stream processes and strong relationship between channel geometry, unit stream power, and D50implies that available driving forces and grain size are the primary controls on stream processes in the study area. We conclude that future research into system response in this and similar settings should focus on sediment characteristics, production, and flux. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Creutin2003b,
abstract = {Implementation of flood warning systems and community self-help programs is one of the most effective ways to mitigate the flash-flood risk. Inmany instances, these are the only affordable and sustainable mitigation approaches. Unfortunately, flash-flood warning is still hampered by changes in societal needs and by our limited knowledge of atmospheric and hydrologic generating mechanisms of this type of flood. On the one hand, flood warning has traditionally focused on localized targets for the protection of communities and for the management of hydraulic reservoirs. Given the general development of dispersed urbanization and transportation, and the expansion of green tourism and water sports in mountainous regions, human lives and property are increasingly exposed to flash-flood hazard in a scatteredmanner. This means that every river section of a monitored region can be considered as a potential target for flood warning. On the other hand, our poor knowledge of this phenomenon comes from the fact that, in most flash-flood cases, the rain accumulations and the discharges are simply unknown over most of the watersheds of concern. Flash floods develop at space and time scales that conventional observation systems of rain and discharge in rivers are not able to monitor. As these events are locally rare, they also escape the realm of field-based experimentation. Consequently, the atmospheric and hydrologic generating mechanisms of flash floods are poorly understood. Progress in flash-flood research is hampered by three main prob- lems: (i) the downscaling problem due to the incoherent space and time scales between atmospheric models and the flash-flood trigger- ing processes; (ii) the ungauged basin problem due to the fact that the small basins prone to flash-floods are seldom gauged and must be modelled without calibration; and (iii) the problem of knowing the limits of the soil retention control of runoff under the range of rain accumulations considered. Our view is that weather radar net- works deeply modify the flash flood monitoring problem. Combin- ing radar detection of rain and distributed hydrological modelling shows considerable potential for improving both the understanding of fundamental scientific questions, including extreme storms and runoff production mechanisms, and the ‘distributed' monitoring of the flash-flood hazard. This short commentary addresses some of these developments and identifies some new research needs in radar hydrology.},

abstract = {Methodologies for developing a macro-scale model of subsurface stormflow generation on a steep forested catchment in Japan are addressed. Field studies on this catchment have indicated that subsurface flow, consisting mainly of 'old' water displaced by 'new' rain water, dominates the storm response. Detailed field measurements on the catchment allowed simple, catchment-scale relationships to be developed between the volume of saturated groundwater, on the one hand, and discharge, and surface and subsurface saturated areas, on the other. Attempts are made to find linkages between these empirical relationships and physically-based descriptions of hydrological processes operating at smaller scales. A distributed model based on the saturated-unsaturated groundwater flow on steep catchments was developed and tested with field data collected on this catchment. Derivation of catchment-scale relationships can be carried out by a straightforward integration of the distributed model output. An alternative disaggregation-aggregation approach is presented, whereby the catchment is divided into a number of hillslope flow strips. By applying the distributed model on each flow strip, under steady-state conditions, it is possible to infer the spatial variability of groundwater volume in the various flow strips. This variability is related to a measure of hillslope topography and geometry. Knowing the catch-ment topography and geometry for any catchment, it is then possible to derive useful catchment-scale relationships which are applicable under quasi-steady-state conditions, Hydrological relationships derived in this manner are compared with corresponding empirical relationships. The methodologies presented are effective for understanding the linkages between catchment scale response and small-scale flow processes.},

Flash-floods develop at space and time scales that conventional observation systems are not able to monitor for rainfall and river discharge. Consequently, the atmospheric and hydrological generating mechanisms of flash-floods are poorly understood, leading to highly uncertain forecasts of these events. The objective of the HYDRATE project has been to improve the scientific basis of flash flood forecasting by advancing and harmonising a European-wide innovative flash flood observation strategy and developing a coherent set of technologies and tools for effective early warning systems. To this end, the project included actions on the organization of the existing flash flood data patrimony across Europe. The final aim of HYDRATE was to enhance the capability of flash flood forecasting in ungauged basins by exploiting the extended availability of flash flood data and the improved process understanding. This paper provides a review of the work conducted in HYDRATE with a special emphasis on how this body of research can contribute to guide the policy-life cycle concerning flash flood risk management. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper concerns the analysis of the 1 October 2009 flash flood and debris flow event caused by a very intense rainfall concentrated over the Messina area. The storm caused severe flash floods in many villages around the city of Messina, such as Giampilieri, Scaletta Zanclea, Altolia Superiore and Molino, with 38 casualties and significant damages to property, buildings, roads and bridges estimated close to 550 million Euro. The main focus of this work is to perform a post event analysis, putting together available meteorological and hydrological data in order to get better insight into temporal and spatial variability of the rain storm, the soil moisture conditions and the consequent flash flood in the Giampilieri catchment. The event was investigated using observed data from a raingauge network. Statistical analysis using GEV distribution was performed and rainfall return period (storm severity) was estimated. Further, measured rainfall data and rainfall-runoff modelling were used to estimate soil moisture conditions, to analyse the hydrological behaviour and to reconstruct flood hydrograph. With the help of GIS technology and particularly spatial analysis, the volume of debris which has gone down into the Giampilieri village was also calculated. GIS maps with landslide and material deposit areas were produced and analysed.},

abstract = {The analysis of Henderson and Wooding, 1964, is expanded in comparing simplified models of subsurface stormflow for the case of a sloping soil mantle in which the hydraulic conductivity is constant throughout. Reviewing studies both in the field and theoretical in nature, the process of subsurface stormflow apparently will be the dominant mode of hydrological response of a hillslope or catchment under the following conditions: soils of high permeability, whether inherent in the soil matrix or due to structural or biotic macropores; and a steep hydraulic gradient, whether due to the slope of hillslopes or to the buildup of groundwater mounds on shallow slopes. The magnitude and timing of the subsurface flow response will depend on the depth and hydraulic conditions of the unsaturated zone at the time of the storm. In this paper only the simplest possible conditions have been studied, with the unsaturated zone being neglected, and constant input to a soil of constant hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity throughout its depth being assumed. It has been shown using data from field and numerical studies of subsurface stormflow that the kinematic approximation may be appropriate for combinations of slope conditions and input rates of practical interest.

abstract = {This study presents an application of an inno- vative sampling strategy to assess soil moisture dynamics in a headwater of the Wei{\ss}eritz in the German eastern Ore Mountains. A grassland site and a forested site were in- strumented with two Spatial TDR clusters (STDR) that con- sist of 39 and 32 coated TDR probes of 60cm length. Dis- tributed time series of vertically averaged soil moisture data from both sites/ensembles were analyzed by statistical and geostatistical methods. Spatial variability and the spatial mean at the forested site were larger than at the grassland site. Furthermore, clustering of TDR probes in combination with long-term monitoring allowed identification of average spatial covariance structures at the small field scale for dif- ferent wetness states. The correlation length of soil water content as well as the sill to nugget ratio at the grassland site increased with increasing average wetness and but, in contrast, were constant at the forested site. As soil proper- ties at both the forested and grassland sites are extremely variable, this suggests that the correlation structure at the forested site is dominated by the pattern of throughfall and interception. We also found a very strong correlation be- tween antecedent soil moisture at the forested site and runoff coefficients of rainfall-runoff events observed at gauge Rehe- feld. Antecedent soil moisture at the forest site explains 92{\%} of the variability in the runoff coefficients. By combining these results with a recession analysis we derived a first con- ceptual model of the dominant runoff mechanisms operating in this catchment. Finally, we employed a physically based hydrological model to shed light on the controls of soil- and plant morphological parameters on soil average soil moisture at the forested site and the grassland site, respectively. A homogeneous soil setup allowed, after fine tuning of plant morphological parameters, most of the time unbiased predic- tions of the observed average soil conditions observed at both field sites. We conclude that the proposed sampling strategy of clustering TDR probes is suitable to assess unbiased aver- age soil moisture dynamics in critical functional units, in this case the forested site, which is a much better predictor for event scale runoff formation than pre-event discharge. Long term monitoring of such critical landscape elements could maybe yield valuable information for flood warning in head- waters. We thus think that STDR provides a good intersect of the advantages of permanent sampling and spatially highly resolved soil moisture sampling using mobile rods.},

abstract = {The village of Pajares de Pedraza (Segovia, Spain) is located in the floodplain of the Cega River, a left bank tributary of the Douro River. Repeated flash flood events occur in this small village because of its upstream catchment area, mountainous character and impermeable lithology, which reduce concentration time to just a few hours. River overbank flow has frequently caused flooding and property damage to homes and rural properties, most notably in 1927, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2013 and 2014. Consequently, a detailed analysis was carried out to quantify the economic risk of flash floods in peri-urban and rural areas. Magnitudes and exceedance probabilities were obtained from a flood frequency analysis of maximum discharges. To determine the extent and characteristics of the flooded area, we performed 2D hydraulic modeling (Iber 2.0 software) based on LIDAR (1 m) topography and considering three different scenarios associated with the initial construction (1997) and subsequent extension (2013) of a linear defense structure (rockfill dike or levee) to protect the population. Specific stage–damage functions were expressly developed using in situ data collection for exposed elements, with special emphasis on urban-type categories. The average number of elements and their unit value were established. The relationship between water depth and the height at which electric outlets, furniture, household goods, etc. were located was analyzed; due to its effect on the form of the function. Other nonspecific magnitude–damage functions were used in order to compare both economic estimates. The results indicate that the use of non-specific magnitude–damage functions leads to a significant overestimation of economic losses, partly linked to the use of general economic cost data. Furthermore, a detailed classification and financial assessment of exposed assets is the most important step to ensure a correct estimate of financial losses. In both cases, this should include a consideration of the socio-economic and cultural conditions prevailing in the area, as well as the types of flood that affect it.},

abstract = {Flash floods represent one of the most destructive natural hazards in the Mediterranean region. These floods result from very intense and spatially heterogeneous rainfall events. Distributed hydrological models are valuable tools to study these phenomena and increase our knowledge on the main processes governing the generation and propagation of floods over large spatial scales. They are generally built using a bottom???up approach that generalizes small-physics representations of processes. However, top???down or data-driven approach is increasingly shown to provide also valuable knowledge. A simplified semi-distributed continuous hydrological model, named SIMPLEFLOOD, was developed, based on the simple dynamical system approach (SDSA) proposed by Kirchner (WRR, 2009, 45, W02429), and applied to the Ard??che catchment in France (2388 km2). This data-driven method assumes that discharge at the outlet of a given catchment can be expressed as a function only of catchment storage. It leads to a 3-parameter nonlinear model according to rainfall and runoff observations. This model was distributed over sub-catchments and coupled with a kinematic wave based flow propagation module. The parameters were estimated by discharge recession analyses at several gauged stations. Parameter regionalization was conducted using a Factorial Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD) and Hierarchical Classification on Principal Component (HCPC) in order to find relationships between the SDSA approach and catchments characteristics. Geology was found to be the main predictor of hydrological response variability and model parameters were regionalized according to the dominant geology. The SIMPLEFLOOD model was applied for a 12-year continuous simulation over the Ard??che catchment. Four flash flood events were also selected for further analysis. The simulated hydrographs were compared with the observations at 11 gauging stations with catchment size ranging from 17 to 2300 km2. The results show a good performance of the model for the continuous and flash flood events occurring under wet conditions, whereas the model underestimates discharge for events occurring after a long dry period. The simple modeling approach provided interesting insight into the Ard??che catchment functioning and offers perspective for a better simulation of flash floods, mainly under wet conditions.},

abstract = {The 2 June 2008 flood-producing storm on the Starzel river basin in South-West Germany is examined as a prototype for organized convective systems that dominate the upper tail of the precipitation frequency distribution and are likely responsible for the flash flood peaks in Central Europe. The availability of high-resolution rainfall estimates from radar observations and a rain gauge network, together with indirect peak discharge estimates from a detailed post-event survey, provided the opportunity to study in detail the hydrometeorological and hydrological mechanisms associated with this extreme storm and the ensuing flood. Radar-derived rainfall, streamgauge data and indirect estimates of peak discharges are used along with a distributed hydrologic model to reconstruct hydrographs at multiple locations. Observations and model results are combined to examine two main questions, (i) assessment of the distribution of the runoff ratio for the 2008 flash flood and how it compares with other less severe floods; and (ii) analysis of how the spatial and temporal distribution of the extreme rainfall, and more specifically storm motion, controls the flood response. It is shown that small runoff ratios (less than 20{\%}) characterized the runoff response and that these values are in the range of other, less extreme, flood events. The influence of storm structure, evolution and motion on the modeled flood hydrograph is examined by using the "spatial moments of catchment rainfall". It is shown that downbasin storm motion (in the range of 0.7-0.9 m s(-1)) had a noticeable impact on flood response by increasing the modeled flood peak by 13 {\%}.},

abstract = {Flash flooding is one of the most costly and deadly natural hazards in the United States and across the globe. This study advances the use of high-resolution quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) for flash flood forecasting. The QPFs are derived from a stormscale ensemble prediction system, and used within a distributed hydrological model framework to yield basin-specific, probabilistic flash flood forecasts (PFFFs). Before creating the PFFFs, it is important to characterize QPF uncertainty, particularly in terms of location which is the most problematic for hydrological use of QPFs. The SAL methodology (Wernli et al., 2008), which stands for structure, amplitude, and location, is used for this error quantification, with a focus on location. Finally, the PFFF methodology is proposed that produces probabilistic hydrological forecasts. The main advantages of this method are: (1) identifying specific basin scales that are forecast to be impacted by flash flooding; (2) yielding probabilistic information about the forecast hydrologic response that accounts for the locational uncertainties of the QPFs; (3) improving lead time by using stormscale NWP ensemble forecasts; and (4) not requiring multiple simulations, which are computationally demanding.},

abstract = {Floods, landslides and debris flows are natural events that occur all over the world and are often induced by extreme rainfall conditions. Several extreme events occurred in Slovenia (Europe) in the last 25. years that caused 18 casualties and approximately 500. million Euros of economic loss. The intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) relationship was constructed using the Frank copula function for several rainfall stations using high-resolution rainfall data with an average subsample length of 34. years. The empirical rainfall threshold curves were also evaluated for selected extreme events. Post-event analyses showed that rainfall characteristics triggering flash floods and landslides are different. The sensitivity analysis results indicate that the inter-event time definition (IETD) and subsample definition methodology can have a significant influence on the position of rainfall events in the intensity-duration space, the constructed IDF curves and on the relationship between the empirical rainfall threshold curves and the IDF curves constructed using the copula approach.

abstract = {The RNA-guided nuclease CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR associated nuclease 9) and its variants such as nickase Cas9, dead Cas9, guide RNA scaffolds and RNA-targeting Cas9 are convenient and versatile platforms for site-specific genome editing and epigenome modulation. They are easy-to-use, simple-to-design, and capable of targeting multiple loci simultaneously. Given that cancer develops from cumulative genetic and epigenetic alterations, CRISPR-Cas9 and its variants (hereafter referred to as CRISPR-Cas9 systems) hold extensive application potentials in cancer modeling and therapy. To date, they have already been applied to model oncogenic mutations in cell lines1 and in adult animals2 , as well as to combat cancer by disabling oncogenic viruses3 or by manipulating cancer genome4 . Given the importance of epigenome and transcriptome in tumorigenesis, manipulation of cancer epigenome and transcriptome for cancer modeling and therapy is a promising area in the future. Whereas (epi)genetic modifications of cancer microenvironment with CRISPR-Cas9 systems for therapeutic purposes represent another promising area in cancer research. Herein, we introduce the functions and mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas9 systems in genome editing and epigenome modulation, retrospect their applications in cancer modelling and therapy, discuss limitations and possible solutions, and propose future directions, in hope of providing concise and enlightening information for readers interested in this area.

abstract = {Recession analysis is a well-known tool in hydrological analysis. Its application, however, poses many methodical questions, and throughout the literature numerous solutions have been sought. The quantification of the recession curve involves the selection of an analytical expression, derivation of a characteristic recession and optimization of the recession parameters. A major problem is the high variability encountered in the recession behaviour of individual segments. The segments represent different stages in the outflow process, and a physically based short-term or seasonal influence on the recession rate adds to the problem of deriving a characteristic recession. This paper discusses these elements of recession analysis and reviews different ways of characterizing the baseflow recession rate. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {This study documents the preferred location and diurnal cycle of extreme convective storms that occur in the tropical band containing the east Pacific Ocean, Central and South America, the Atlantic Ocean, and northern Africa. Data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar show three types of convective-stratiform structures that constitute extreme convective events: deep convective cores (DCCs), wide convective cores (WCCs), and broad stratiform regions (BSRs). Interim ECMWF Re- Analysis (ERA-Interim) data show the associated synoptic environmental factors associated with the oc- currence of extreme convective features. The DCC, WCC, and BSRechoes are associated with early, middle, and late stages of convective system development, respectively, and the statistics and timing of their occur- rence are related to topography and life cycle behavior of the convection. Storms containing DCC occur primarily over the Sudanian savannas of Africa and near the mountains in northern South America, being diurnally controlled. Storms with WCC manifest over land, in the same regions as the DCC, but also over oceanic regions. They appear around the clock but with maximum frequency at night. They are favored in regions of midlevel synoptic-scale low pressure systems, which over the sub-Sahara are the troughs of easterly waves. Storms containing BSR maximize over oceanic regions west of Africa and South America, where they exhibit a weak diurnal cycle with a slight midmorning maximum. Off the west coast of South America, the storms withWCCand BSR have longer lifetimes enhanced by orographic lifting over the Andes. The storms with BSR in the east Pacific Ocean often develop into tropical cyclones. 1.},

abstract = {Runoff estimation in ungauged catchments is probably one of the most basic and oldest tasks of hydrologists. This long-standing issue has received increased attention recently due to the PUB (Prediction in Ungauged Basins) initiative. Given the challenges of predicting runoff for ungauged catchments one might argue that the best course of action is to take a few runoff measurements. In this study we explored how implementing such a procedure might support predictions in an ungauged basin. We used a number of monitored Swedish catchments as hypothetical ungauged basins where we pretended to start with no runoff data and then added different sub-sets of the available data to constrain a simple catchment model. These sub-sets consisted of a limited number of single runoff measurements; in other words these data represent what could be measured with limited efforts in an ungauged basin. We used a Monte Carlo approach and predicted runoff as a weighted ensemble mean of simulations using acceptable parameter sets. We found that the ensemble prediction clearly outperformed the predictions using single parameter sets and that surprisingly little runoff data was necessary to identify model parameterizations that provided good results for the "ungauged" test periods. These results indicated that a few runoff measurements can contain much of the information content of continuous runoff time series. However, the study also indicated that results may differ significantly between catchments and also depend on the days chosen for taking the measurements.},

In an attempt to overcome this problem we have combined archival records, dendrogeomorphic time series and instrumental data (daily rainfall and discharge) from four ungauged and poorly gauged mountain basins in Central Spain with the aim of reconstructing and compiling information on 41 flash flood events since the end of the 19th century. Estimation of historical discharge and the incorporation of uncertainty for the at-site and regional flood frequency analysis were performed with an empirical rainfall-runoff assessment as well as stochastic and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches. Results for each of the ungauged basins include flood frequency, severity, seasonality and triggers (synoptic meteorological situations). The reconstructed data series clearly demonstrates how uncertainty can be reduced by including historical information, but also points to the considerable influence of different approaches on quantile estimation. This uncertainty should be taken into account when these data are used for flood risk management. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Heavy rainstorms often induce flash flooding, one of the natural disasters most responsible for damage to man-made infrastructure and loss of lives, adversely affecting also the opportunities for socio-economic development of Mediterranean Countries. The frequently dramatic damage of flash floods are often detected with sufficient accuracy by post-event surveys, but rainfall causing them are still only roughly characterized. With the aim of improving the understanding of the temporal structure and spatial distribution of heavy rainstorms in the Mediterranean context, a statistical analysis was carried out in Calabria (southern Italy) concerning rainstorms that mainly induced flash floods, but also shallow landslides and debris-flows. Thus a method is proposed – based on the overcoming of heuristically predetermined threshold values of cumulated rainfall, maximum intensity, and kinetic energy of the rainfall event – to select and characterize the rainstorms able to induce flash floods in the Mediterranean-climate Countries. Therefore the obtained (heavy) rainstorms were automatically classified and studied according to their structure in time, localization and extension. Rainfall-runoff watershed models can consequently benefit from the enhanced identification of design storms, with a realistic time structure integrated with the results of the spatial analysis. A survey of flash flood events recorded in the last decades provides a preliminary validation of the method proposed to identify the heavy rainstorms and synthetically describe their characteristics. The notable size of the employed sample, including data with a very detailed resolution in time, that relate to several rain gauges well-distributed throughout the region, give robustness to the obtained results.},

abstract = {A spatially distributed hydrological model, dedicated to flood simulation, is developed on the basis of physical process representation (infiltration, overland flow, channel routing). Estimation of model parameters requires data concerning topography, soil properties, vegetation and land use. Four parameters are calibrated for the entire catchment using one flood event. Model sensitivity to individual parameters is assessed using Monte-Carlo simulations. Results of this sensitivity analysis with a criterion based on the Nash efficiency coefficient and the error of peak time and runoff are used to calibrate the model. This procedure is tested on the Gardon d'Anduze catchment, located in the Mediterranean zone of southern France. A first validation is conducted using three flood events with different hydrometeorological characteristics. This sensitivity analysis along with validation tests illustrates the predictive capability of the model and points out the possible improvements on the model's structure and parameterization for flash flood forecasting, especially in ungauged basins. Concerning the model structure, results show that water transfer through the subsurface zone also contributes to the hydrograph response to an extreme event, especially during the recession period. Maps of soil saturation emphasize the impact of rainfall and soil properties variability on these dynamics. Adding a subsurface flow component in the simulation also greatly impacts the spatial distribution of soil saturation and shows the importance of the drainage network. Measures of such distributed variables would help discriminating between different possible model structures.},

abstract = {The village of Pajares de Pedraza (Segovia, Spain) is located in the floodplain of the Cega River, a left bank tributary of the Douro River. Repeated flash flood events occur in this small village because of its upstream catchment area, mountainous character and impermeable lithology, which reduce concentration time to just a few hours. River overbank flow has frequently caused flooding and property damage to homes and rural properties, most notably in 1927, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2013 and 2014. Consequently, a detailed analysis was carried out to quantify the economic risk of flash floods in peri-urban and rural areas. Magnitudes and exceedance probabilities were obtained from a flood frequency analysis of maximum discharges. To determine the extent and characteristics of the flooded area, we performed 2D hydraulic modeling (Iber 2.0 software) based on LIDAR (1 m) topography and considering three different scenarios associated with the initial construction (1997) and subsequent extension (2013) of a linear defense structure (rockfill dike or levee) to protect the population. Specific stage???damage functions were expressly developed using in situ data collection for exposed elements, with special emphasis on urban-type categories. The average number of elements and their unit value were established. The relationship between water depth and the height at which electric outlets, furniture, household goods, etc. were located was analyzed; due to its effect on the form of the function. Other nonspecific magnitude???damage functions were used in order to compare both economic estimates. The results indicate that the use of non-specific magnitude???damage functions leads to a significant overestimation of economic losses, partly linked to the use of general economic cost data. Furthermore, a detailed classification and financial assessment of exposed assets is the most important step to ensure a correct estimate of financial losses. In both cases, this should include a consideration of the socio-economic and cultural conditions prevailing in the area, as well as the types of flood that affect it.},

abstract = {Predictions in ungauged basins have been a major challenge in hydrologic sciences, and there is still much work needed to achieve robust and reliable predictions for such basins. Here, we propose and test a novel approach for predicting runoff from poorly gauged basins using a minimum complex model calibrated with isotope data alone (i.e., without observed discharge data). The model is composed of two water-stores (soil water and groundwater) and considers their connectivity to runoff in terms of both water and isotope budgets. In a meso-scale basin in which riverbed deformations frequently occur, making automatic observation of river discharge difficult, we measured hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition ($\delta$2H and $\delta$18O) of precipitation and river water twice-weekly for one year. Runoff predicted by the model agreed well with that observed monthly or bimonthly. Monte Carlo simulation revealed a strong coherence between model performance in isotope simulation and runoff prediction, demonstrating that the use of isotopes as dynamic proxies of calibration targets helps reliably constrain model parameters. Our results indicate that this approach can serve as a powerful tool for prediction of runoff hydrographs, particularly for basins in which the stage-discharge relationship is highly variable.},

abstract = {Mesoscale convective cloud systems that produce large amounts of rain in mid-latitudes and most of the rain in the tropics consist of a combination of convective and stratiform cloud. The convective regions contain numerous deep cells that are often but not always arranged in Lines. The stratiform region is an outgrowth of the convective ensemble; it lies adjacent to the convective region and is seeded by ice particles detrained from convective towers. Sometimes it lies to the rear of a propagating convective line, while on other occasions it surrounds the convection. The heating of the large-scale environment by a mesoscale convective system is affected by both the convective and stratiform regions. Although processes such as melting and radiation are important, the net heating by a system is dominated by condensation and evaporation associated with vertical air motions. This paper reviews recent observational evidence regarding the mean vertical motion profiles in the convective and stratiform regions of mesoscale convective systems and the implications of these mean motions for the vertical distribution of heating of the large-scale environment. In both the convective and the stratiform regions, vertical motions have been determined by various techniques, including composites of rawinsonde and aircraft wind data, single- and dual-Doppler precipitation radar analyses, and wind-profiler observations. In stratiform regions, these data consistently show mean vertical velocity that is upward in the upper troposphere and downward in the lower troposphere. The level separating upward from downward motion is located from 0 to 2 km above the 0°C level, depending on location within the stratiform region. Diagnostic calculations show that these vertical motion profiles imply heating of the upper troposphere and cooling of lower levels by stratiform-region processes. Data on vertical motions in the convective regions are less consistent from case to case. These data sometimes indicate that the mean vertical velocity in convective regions is maximum in the lower troposphere. In other cases, the data indicate a maximum in the high troposphere. Diagnostic calculations show that heating profiles diagnosed from these two types of profile are quite different, the first having a maximum of heating in the lower troposphere, while the second has a maximum in the middle troposphere. Although it is difficult to determine whether or not the differences in estimates arise from different types of observations, analysis methods or sampling strategies, it seems likely that they stem from differences in the large-scale environment of the different mesoscale systems. The ubiquitous occurrence of stratiform regions in mesoscale convective systems and hurricanes together with their consistent heating profiles, which systematically concentrate heating in upper levels while cooling lower levels, are a major consideration in evaluating the interaction of mesoscale systems with the large-scale environment. However, the consistency of the stratiform profiles from case to case indicates that the variability of net (convective plus stratiform) heating profiles from case to case ties primarily in the variation of the convective-region profiles from one case to another. It is suggested that future work should focus on the convective-region vertical profiles of vertical motion and heating and on the large-scale environmental factors that may control the variation of these profiles from case to case. 1.},

Consequently, the atmospheric, hydrological and geomorphic controls on these hydrogeomorphic processes are poorly understood, leading to highly uncertain warning and risk management. On the other hand, remote sensing of precipitation and numerical weather predictions have become the basis of several flood forecasting systems, enabling increasingly accurate detection of hazardous events. The objective of this paper is to provide a review on current European and international research on early warning systems for flash floods and debris flows. We expand upon these themes by identifying: (a) the state of the art; (b) knowledge gaps; and (c) suggested research directions to advance warning capabilities for extreme hydrogeomorphic processes. We also suggest three areas in which advancements in science will have immediate and important practical consequence, namely development of rainfall estimation and nowcasting schemes suited to the specific space-time scales, consolidating physical, engineering and social datasets of flash floods and debris-flows, integration of methods for multiple hydrogeomorphic hazard warning.},

abstract = {The characterization of the spatial-temporal variability of soil moisture is of paramount importance in many scientific fields and operational applications. However, due to the high variability of soil moisture, its monitoring over large areas and for extended periods through in situ point measurements is not straightforward. Usually, in the scientific literature, soil moisture variability has been investigated over short periods and in large areas or over long periods but in small areas. In this study, an effort to understanding soil moisture variability at catchment scale ({\textgreater}100km 
                        2), which is the size needed for some hydrological applications and for remote sensing validation analysis, is done. Specifically, measurements were carried out in two adjacent areas located in central Italy with extension of 178 and 242km 
                        2 and over a period of 1year (35 sampling days) with almost weekly frequency except for the summer period because of soil hardness. For each area, 46 sites were monitored and, for each site, 3 measurements were performed to obtain reliable soil moisture estimates. Soil moisture was measured with a portable Time Domain Reflectometer for a layer depth of 0-15cm. A statistical and temporal stability analysis is employed to assess the space-time variability of soil moisture at local and catchment scale. Moreover, by comparing the results with those obtained in previous studies conducted in the same study area, a synthesis of soil moisture variability for a range of spatial scales, from few square meters to several square kilometers, is attempted. For the investigated area, the two main findings inferred are: (1) the spatial variability of soil moisture increases with the area up to {\~{}}10km 
                        2 and then remains quite constant with an average coefficient of variation equal to {\~{}}0.20; (2) regardless of the areal extension, the soil moisture exhibits temporal stability features and, hence, few measurements can be used to infer areal mean values with a good accuracy (determination coefficient higher than 0.88). These insights based on in situ soil moisture observations corroborate the opportunity to use point information for the validation of coarse resolution satellite images. Moreover, the feasibility to use coarse resolution data for hydrological applications in small to medium sized catchments is confirmed. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

This is especially the case in the Mediterranean and oversea territories/departments of France, characterized by extreme hydro-climatological features and with a large part of the population exposed to flood risks. The recurrence of remarkable flash flood events, associated with high hazard intensity, significant damage and socio-political consequences, therefore raises several issues for authorities and risk management policies. This study aims to improve our understanding of the hazard analysis process in the case of four remarkable flood events: March 1930, October 1940, January 1980 and November 1999. Firstly, we present the methodology used to define the remarkability score of a flood event. Then, to identify the factors leading to a remarkable flood event, we explore the main parameters of the hazard analysis process, such as the meteorological triggering conditions, the return period of the rainfall and peak discharge, as well as some additional factors (initial catchment state, flood chronology, cascade effects, etc.). The results contribute to understanding the complexity of the processes leading to flood hazard and highlight the importance for risk managers of taking additional factors into account.},

abstract = {Implementation of flood warning systems and community self-help programs is one of the most effective ways to mitigate the flash-flood risk. Inmany instances, these are the only affordable and sustainable mitigation approaches. Unfortunately, flash-flood warning is still hampered by changes in societal needs and by our limited knowledge of atmospheric and hydrologic generating mechanisms of this type of flood. On the one hand, flood warning has traditionally focused on localized targets for the protection of communities and for the management of hydraulic reservoirs. Given the general development of dispersed urbanization and transportation, and the expansion of green tourism and water sports in mountainous regions, human lives and property are increasingly exposed to flash-flood hazard in a scatteredmanner. This means that every river section of a monitored region can be considered as a potential target for flood warning. On the other hand, our poor knowledge of this phenomenon comes from the fact that, in most flash-flood cases, the rain accumulations and the discharges are simply unknown over most of the watersheds of concern. Flash floods develop at space and time scales that conventional observation systems of rain and discharge in rivers are not able to monitor. As these events are locally rare, they also escape the realm of field-based experimentation. Consequently, the atmospheric and hydrologic generating mechanisms of flash floods are poorly understood. Progress in flash-flood research is hampered by three main prob- lems: (i) the downscaling problem due to the incoherent space and time scales between atmospheric models and the flash-flood trigger- ing processes; (ii) the ungauged basin problem due to the fact that the small basins prone to flash-floods are seldom gauged and must be modelled without calibration; and (iii) the problem of knowing the limits of the soil retention control of runoff under the range of rain accumulations considered. Our view is that weather radar net- works deeply modify the flash flood monitoring problem. Combin- ing radar detection of rain and distributed hydrological modelling shows considerable potential for improving both the understanding of fundamental scientific questions, including extreme storms and runoff production mechanisms, and the ‘distributed' monitoring of the flash-flood hazard. This short commentary addresses some of these developments and identifies some new research needs in radar hydrology.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to analyse the potential relationship between flash flood events and convective precipitation in Catalonia, as well as any related trends. The paper starts with an overview of flash floods and their trends in the Mediterranean region, along with their associated factors, followed by the definition of, identification of, and trends in convective precipitation. After this introduction the paper focuses on the north-eastern Iberian Peninsula, for which there is a long-term precipitation series (since 1928) of 1-min precipitation from the Fabra Observatory, as well as a shorter (1996???2011) but more extensive precipitation series (43 rain gauges) of 5-min precipitation. Both series have been used to characterise the degree of convective contribution to rainfall, introducing the ?? parameter as the ratio between convective precipitation versus total precipitation in any period. Information about flood events was obtained from the INUNGAMA database (a flood database created by the GAMA team), with the aim of finding any potential links to convective precipitation. These flood data were gathered using information on damage where flood is treated as a multifactorial risk, and where any trend or anomaly might have been caused by one or more factors affecting hazard, vulnerability or exposure. Trend analysis has shown an increase in flash flood events. The fact that no trends were detected in terms of extreme values of precipitation on a daily scale, nor on the associated ETCCDI (Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices) extreme index, could point to an increase in vulnerability, an increase in exposure, or changes in land use. However, the summer increase in convective precipitation was concentrated in less torrential events, which could partially explain this positive trend in flash flood events. The ?? parameter has been also used to characterise the type of flood event according to the features of the precipitation. The highest values correspond to short and local events, usually with daily ?? values above 0.5, while the minimum threshold of daily ?? for catastrophic flash floods is 0.31.},

abstract = {Estimation of rainfall intensity-duration thresholds, used for the identification of debris flow/landslide triggering rainfall events, has been traditionally based on raingauge observations. The main drawback of using information from gauges is that the measurement stations are usually located far away from the debris flow initiation areas. In complex terrain where debris flows take place, the spatial variability of rainfall can be very high and this translates in large uncertainty of raingauge-based estimates of debris flow triggering rainfall. This work focuses on the assessment of the impact of rainfall estimation uncertainty on identification and use of rainfall thresholds for debris flow occurrence. The Upper Adige River basin, Northern Italy, is the area of study. A detailed database of more than 400 identified debris flow initiation points during the period 2000-2010 and a raingauge network of 100 stations comprise the database used for this work. The methodology examines the intensity-duration thresholds derived from a set of raingauges that are assumed to be located at debris flow initiation points (DFRs) and an equivalent set of raingauges assumed to have the role of the closest (to debris flow) available measurement (MRs). A set of reference rainfall thresholds is used to identify the rainfall events at DFRs that "triggered" debris flows (i.e. exceed the threshold). For these same events, the corresponding rainfall thresholds are derived from MR observations. Comparison between the rainfall thresholds derived from DFRs and MRs revealed that uncertainty in rainfall estimation has a major impact on estimated intensity-duration thresholds. Specifically, the results showed that thresholds estimated from MR observations are consistently underestimated. Evaluation of the estimated thresholds for warning procedures showed that while detection is high, the main issue is the high false alarm ratio, which limits the overall accuracy of the procedure. Overall performance on debris flow prediction was shown to be good for low rainfall thresholds and poor for high rainfall thresholds examined. Lastly, it was found that filtering out rainfall events with duration {\textless}. 12. h may improve bias in estimated thresholds and performance for high rainfall thresholds. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Heavy rainstorms often induce flash flooding, one of the natural disasters most responsible for damage to man-made infrastructure and loss of lives, adversely affecting also the opportunities for socio-economic development of Mediterranean Countries. The frequently dramatic damage of flash floods are often detected with sufficient accuracy by post-event surveys, but rainfall causing them are still only roughly characterized. With the aim of improving the understanding of the temporal structure and spatial distribution of heavy rainstorms in the Mediterranean context, a statistical analysis was carried out in Calabria (southern Italy) concerning rainstorms that mainly induced flash floods, but also shallow landslides and debris-flows. Thus a method is proposed – based on the overcoming of heuristically predetermined threshold values of cumulated rainfall, maximum intensity, and kinetic energy of the rainfall event – to select and characterize the rainstorms able to induce flash floods in the Mediterranean-climate Countries. Therefore the obtained (heavy) rainstorms were automatically classified and studied according to their structure in time, localization and extension. Rainfall-runoff watershed models can consequently benefit from the enhanced identification of design storms, with a realistic time structure integrated with the results of the spatial analysis. A survey of flash flood events recorded in the last decades provides a preliminary validation of the method proposed to identify the heavy rainstorms and synthetically describe their characteristics. The notable size of the employed sample, including data with a very detailed resolution in time, that relate to several rain gauges well-distributed throughout the region, give robustness to the obtained results.},

Nevertheless, the ability to generalize these findings to ungauged regions remains out of reach. In spite of their apparent physical basis and complexity, the current generation of detailed models is process weak. Their representations of the internal states and process dynamics are still at odds with many experimental findings. In order to make continued progress in watershed hydrology and to bring greater coherence to the science, we need to move beyond the status quo of having to explicitly characterize or prescribe landscape heterogeneity in our (highly calibrated) models and in this way reproduce process complexity and instead explore the set of organizing principles that might underlie the heterogeneity and complexity.

abstract = {Flash flooding is one of the most costly and deadly natural hazards in the United States and across the globe. This study advances the use of high-resolution quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) for flash flood forecasting. The QPFs are derived from a stormscale ensemble prediction system, and used within a distributed hydrological model framework to yield basin-specific, probabilistic flash flood forecasts (PFFFs). Before creating the PFFFs, it is important to characterize QPF uncertainty, particularly in terms of location which is the most problematic for hydrological use of QPFs. The SAL methodology (Wernli et al., 2008), which stands for structure, amplitude, and location, is used for this error quantification, with a focus on location. Finally, the PFFF methodology is proposed that produces probabilistic hydrological forecasts. The main advantages of this method are: (1) identifying specific basin scales that are forecast to be impacted by flash flooding; (2) yielding probabilistic information about the forecast hydrologic response that accounts for the locational uncertainties of the QPFs; (3) improving lead time by using stormscale NWP ensemble forecasts; and (4) not requiring multiple simulations, which are computationally demanding.},

Low runoff ratios were likely related to the$\backslash$nresponse of the riparian zone, which was almost always close to$\backslash$nsaturation. High runoff ratios occurred during wet antecedent$\backslash$nconditions, when the soil moisture threshold was exceeded.

abstract = {Semiarid flash floods pose a significant danger for life and property in many dry regions around the world. One effective way to mitigate flood risk lies in implementing a real-time forecast and warning system based on a rainfall-runoff model. This study used a semiarid, physics-based, and spatially distributed watershed model driven by high-resolution radar rainfall input to evaluate such a system. The predictive utility of the model and dominant sources of uncertainty were investigated for several runoff events within the U.S. Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed located in the southwestern United States. Sources of uncertainty considered were rainfall estimates, watershed model parameters, and initial soil moisture conditions. Results derived through a variance-based comprehensive global sensitivity analysis indicated that the high predictive uncertainty in the modeled response was heavily dominated by biases in the radar rainfall depth estimates. Key model parameters and initial model states were identified, and we generally found that modeled hillslope characteristics are more influential than channel characteristics in small semiarid basins. We also observed an inconsistency in the parameter sets identified as behavioral for different events, which suggests that model calibration to historical data is unlikely to consistently improve predictive performance for different events and that real-time parameter updating may be preferable.},

abstract = {The soil water content is recognized as one of many runoff controlling factors in semiarid environments. A simple, physically based distributed model has been developed to study the role of antecedent soil water content in runoff generation in three small catchments in semiarid southeast Spain. The catchments were set up in two different zones: a burnt area with scarce vegetation and unburnt area with a denser plant cover. The infiltration process is determined by the Green-Ampt equation and the initial soil water content is taken into account by means of maps obtained by Conditional Gaussian simulation. The model was run 2700 times with different soil moisture scenarios and design storms. Stochastic sensitivity analysis was used to examine the role of antecedent soil water content in the runoff response. The results showed that the hydrological response after high intensity, low frequency storms is independent of the initial soil water content. On the other hand, the antecedent soil water content is an important factor controlling runoff during medium and low intensity storms, a type of rainstorm that is relatively frequent in semiarid areas. The sensitivity of the runoff response to soil moisture depended on the predominant runoff mechanisms. When infiltration excess overland flow is predominant, as a result of high rain intensities or less permeable soils, the runoff response is more uniform and does not depend on initial soil moisture. Runoff from less intense storms on soils of higher permeability is controlled by the soil water content of the surface soil layers and is more dependent on initial conditions. The role of the initial soil water content is more important in catchments where the presence of plant cover produces a patchwork of runoff and runon sites, whose spatial pattern is highly dependent on the soil water status. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Ambiguities in the representation of environmental processes have manifested themselves in a plethora of hydrological models, differing in almost every aspect of their conceptualization and implementation. The current overabundance of models is symptomatic of an insufficient scientific understanding of environmental dynamics at the catchment scale, which can be attributed to difficulties in measuring and representing the heterogeneity encountered in natural systems. This commentary advocates using the method of multiple working hypotheses for systematic and stringent testing of model alternatives in hydrology. We discuss how the multiple-hypothesis approach provides the flexibility to formulate alternative representations (hypotheses) describing both individual processes and the overall system. When combined with incisive diagnostics to scrutinize multiple model representations against observed data, this provides hydrologists with a powerful and systematic approach for model development and improvement. Multiple-hypothesis frameworks also support a broader coverage of the model hypothesis space and hence improve the quantification of predictive uncertainty arising from system and component nonidentifiabilities. As part of discussing the advantages and limitations of multiple-hypothesis frameworks, we critically review major contemporary challenges in hydrological hypothesis-testing, including exploiting different types of data to investigate the fidelity of alternative process representations, accounting for model structure ambiguities arising from major uncertainties in environmental data, quantifying regional differences in dominant hydrological processes, and the grander challenge of understanding the self-organization and optimality principles that may functionally explain and describe the heterogeneities evident in most environmental systems. We assess recent progress in these research directions, and how new advances are possible using multiple-hypothesis methodologies.},

abstract = {Mesoscale convective cloud systems that produce large amounts of rain in mid-latitudes and most of the rain in the tropics consist of a combination of convective and stratiform cloud. The convective regions contain numerous deep cells that are often but not always arranged in Lines. The stratiform region is an outgrowth of the convective ensemble; it lies adjacent to the convective region and is seeded by ice particles detrained from convective towers. Sometimes it lies to the rear of a propagating convective line, while on other occasions it surrounds the convection. The heating of the large-scale environment by a mesoscale convective system is affected by both the convective and stratiform regions. Although processes such as melting and radiation are important, the net heating by a system is dominated by condensation and evaporation associated with vertical air motions. This paper reviews recent observational evidence regarding the mean vertical motion profiles in the convective and stratiform regions of mesoscale convective systems and the implications of these mean motions for the vertical distribution of heating of the large-scale environment. In both the convective and the stratiform regions, vertical motions have been determined by various techniques, including composites of rawinsonde and aircraft wind data, single- and dual-Doppler precipitation radar analyses, and wind-profiler observations. In stratiform regions, these data consistently show mean vertical velocity that is upward in the upper troposphere and downward in the lower troposphere. The level separating upward from downward motion is located from 0 to 2 km above the 0°C level, depending on location within the stratiform region. Diagnostic calculations show that these vertical motion profiles imply heating of the upper troposphere and cooling of lower levels by stratiform-region processes. Data on vertical motions in the convective regions are less consistent from case to case. These data sometimes indicate that the mean vertical velocity in convective regions is maximum in the lower troposphere. In other cases, the data indicate a maximum in the high troposphere. Diagnostic calculations show that heating profiles diagnosed from these two types of profile are quite different, the first having a maximum of heating in the lower troposphere, while the second has a maximum in the middle troposphere. Although it is difficult to determine whether or not the differences in estimates arise from different types of observations, analysis methods or sampling strategies, it seems likely that they stem from differences in the large-scale environment of the different mesoscale systems. The ubiquitous occurrence of stratiform regions in mesoscale convective systems and hurricanes together with their consistent heating profiles, which systematically concentrate heating in upper levels while cooling lower levels, are a major consideration in evaluating the interaction of mesoscale systems with the large-scale environment. However, the consistency of the stratiform profiles from case to case indicates that the variability of net (convective plus stratiform) heating profiles from case to case ties primarily in the variation of the convective-region profiles from one case to another. It is suggested that future work should focus on the convective-region vertical profiles of vertical motion and heating and on the large-scale environmental factors that may control the variation of these profiles from case to case. 1.},

abstract = {A spatially distributed hydrological model, dedicated to flood simulation, is developed on the basis of physical process representation (infiltration, overland flow, channel routing). Estimation of model parameters requires data concerning topography, soil properties, vegetation and land use. Four parameters are calibrated for the entire catchment using one flood event. Model sensitivity to individual parameters is assessed using Monte-Carlo simulations. Results of this sensitivity analysis with a criterion based on the Nash efficiency coefficient and the error of peak time and runoff are used to calibrate the model. This procedure is tested on the Gardon d'Anduze catchment, located in the Mediterranean zone of southern France. A first validation is conducted using three flood events with different hydrometeorological characteristics. This sensitivity analysis along with validation tests illustrates the predictive capability of the model and points out the possible improvements on the model's structure and parameterization for flash flood forecasting, especially in ungauged basins. Concerning the model structure, results show that water transfer through the subsurface zone also contributes to the hydrograph response to an extreme event, especially during the recession period. Maps of soil saturation emphasize the impact of rainfall and soil properties variability on these dynamics. Adding a subsurface flow component in the simulation also greatly impacts the spatial distribution of soil saturation and shows the importance of the drainage network. Measures of such distributed variables would help discriminating between different possible model structures.},

abstract = {Implementation of flood warning systems and community self-help programs is one of the most effective ways to mitigate the flash-flood risk. Inmany instances, these are the only affordable and sustainable mitigation approaches. Unfortunately, flash-flood warning is still hampered by changes in societal needs and by our limited knowledge of atmospheric and hydrologic generating mechanisms of this type of flood. On the one hand, flood warning has traditionally focused on localized targets for the protection of communities and for the management of hydraulic reservoirs. Given the general development of dispersed urbanization and transportation, and the expansion of green tourism and water sports in mountainous regions, human lives and property are increasingly exposed to flash-flood hazard in a scatteredmanner. This means that every river section of a monitored region can be considered as a potential target for flood warning. On the other hand, our poor knowledge of this phenomenon comes from the fact that, in most flash-flood cases, the rain accumulations and the discharges are simply unknown over most of the watersheds of concern. Flash floods develop at space and time scales that conventional observation systems of rain and discharge in rivers are not able to monitor. As these events are locally rare, they also escape the realm of field-based experimentation. Consequently, the atmospheric and hydrologic generating mechanisms of flash floods are poorly understood. Progress in flash-flood research is hampered by three main prob- lems: (i) the downscaling problem due to the incoherent space and time scales between atmospheric models and the flash-flood trigger- ing processes; (ii) the ungauged basin problem due to the fact that the small basins prone to flash-floods are seldom gauged and must be modelled without calibration; and (iii) the problem of knowing the limits of the soil retention control of runoff under the range of rain accumulations considered. Our view is that weather radar net- works deeply modify the flash flood monitoring problem. Combin- ing radar detection of rain and distributed hydrological modelling shows considerable potential for improving both the understanding of fundamental scientific questions, including extreme storms and runoff production mechanisms, and the ‘distributed' monitoring of the flash-flood hazard. This short commentary addresses some of these developments and identifies some new research needs in radar hydrology.},

The recurrence of remarkable flash flood events, associated with high hazard intensity, significant damage and socio-political consequences, therefore raises several issues for authorities and risk management policies. This study aims to improve our understanding of the hazard analysis process in the case of four remarkable flood events: March 1930, October 1940, January 1980 and November 1999. Firstly, we present the methodology used to define the remarkability score of a flood event. Then, to identify the factors leading to a remarkable flood event, we explore the main parameters of the hazard analysis process, such as the meteorological triggering conditions, the return period of the rainfall and peak discharge, as well as some additional factors (initial catchment state, flood chronology, cascade effects, etc.). The results contribute to understanding the complexity of the processes leading to flood hazard and highlight the importance for risk managers of taking additional factors into account.},

abstract = {A regional study of snow avalanche processes was undertaken in the SE Pyrenees. Dendrogeomorphology was used to date and reconstruct large-scale snow avalanche events that occurred in the last four decades. Dendrochronological analyses yielded the dates of nine winters when avalanches occurred in the recent past in six studied avalanche paths. Some of these avalanches were already known, but others had not been documented. In one case, the existing avalanche path map was improved with the dendrogeomorphological information of a larger past event. As a result of the dendrogeomorphological analyses, evidence for three regional-scale major avalanche years was identified in the SE Pyrenees from 1971 to 2004: 1971-1972, 1995-1996 and 2002-2003. The specific synoptic atmospheric situations and the most likely nivometeorological and snowpack conditions that released these major avalanches were determined using weather data for the seasons of major avalanche releases. In 1971-1972 the snow avalanche episode was characterized by a deep trough crossing the Pyrenees. In 1995-1996 a variety of meteorological situations produced several episodes of major avalanches. In 2002-2003 the more significant of two episodes was attributed to a north advection pumping an arctic air mass over the Pyrenees. The 1995-1996 avalanche season proved to be the most notable in the four past decades in the Pyrenees.},

For this reason, landslide hazard assessment and the capacity to predict this phenomenon have been topics of great interest within the scientific community for the implementation of early warning systems. Although several models have been proposed to forecast shallow landslides triggered by rainfall, few models have incorporated geotechnical factors into a complete hydrological model of a basin that can simulate the storage and movement of rainwater through the soil profile. These basin and full hydrological models have adopted a physically based approach. This paper develops a conceptual and physically based model called open and distributed hydrological simulation and landslides—SHIA{\_}Landslide (Simulaci{\'{o}}n HIdrol{\'{o}}gica Abierta, or SHIA, in Spanish)—that is supported by geotechnical and hydrological features occurring on a basin-wide scale in tropical and mountainous terrains. SHIA{\_}Landslide is an original and significant contribution that offers a new perspective with which to analyse shallow landslide processes by incorporating a comprehensive distributed hydrological tank model that includes water storage in the soil coupled with a classical analysis of infinite slope stability under saturated conditions. SHIA{\_}Landslide can be distinguished by the following: (i) its capacity to capture surface topography and effects concerning the subsurface flow; (ii) its use of digital terrain model (DTM) to establish the relationships among cells, geomorphological parameters, slope angle, direction, etc.; (iii) its continuous simulation of rainfall data over long periods and event simulations of specific storms; (iv) its consideration of the effects of horizontal and vertical flow; and (vi) its inclusion of a hydrologically complete water process that allows for hydrological calibration. SHIA{\_}Landslide can be combined with real-time rainfall data and implemented in early warning systems.},

abstract = {Rainfall-runoff models are crucial tools for the statistical prediction of ﬂash ﬂoods and real-time forecasting. This paper focuses on a karstic basin in the South of France and proposes a distributed parsimonious event-based rainfall-runoff model, coherent with the poor knowledge of both evaporative and underground ﬂuxes. The model combines a SCS runoff model and a Lag and Route routing model for each cell of a regular grid mesh. The efﬁciency of the model is discussed not only to satisfactorily simulate ﬂoods but also to get powerful relationships between the initial condition of the model and various predictors of the initial wetness state of the basin, such as the base ﬂow, the Hu2 index from the Meteo-France SIM model and the piezometric levels of the aquifer. The advantage of using meteorological radar rainfall in ﬂood modelling is also assessed. Model calibration proved to be satisfactory by using an hourly time step with Nash criterion values, ranging between 0.66 and 0.94 for eighteen of the twenty-one selected events. The radar rainfall inputs signiﬁcantly improved the simulations or the assessment of the initial condition of the model for 5 events at the beginning of autumn, mostly in September–October (mean improvement of Nash is 0.09; correction in the initial condition ranges from −205 to 124 mm), but were less efﬁ- cient for the events at the end of autumn. In this period, the weak vertical extension of the precipitation system and the low altitude of the 0 ◦ C isotherm could affect the efﬁciency of radar measurements due to the distance between the basin and the radar (∼60 km). The model initial condition S is correlated with the three tested predictors (R 2 {\textgreater} 0.6). The interpretation of the model suggests that groundwater does not affect the ﬁrst peaks of the ﬂood, but can strongly impact subsequent peaks in the case of a multi-storm event. Because this kind of model is based on a limited amount of readily available data, it should be suitable for operational applications.},

abstract = {We have conducted extensive hydrologic simulation experiments in order to investigate how the flood scaling parameters in the power-law relationship Q(A) = $\alpha$A$\theta$, between peak-discharges resulting from a single rainfall-runoff event Q(A) and upstream area A, change as a function of rainfall, runoff coefficient (C r) that we use as a proxy for catchment antecedent moisture state, hillslope overland flow velocity (vh), and channel flow velocity (vc), all of which are variable in space. We use a physically-based distributed numerical framework that is based on an accurate representation of the drainage network and apply it to the Cedar River basin (A = 16, 861 km2), which is located in Eastern Iowa, USA. Our work is motivated by seminal empirical studies that show that the flood scaling parameters $\alpha$ and $\theta$ change from event to event. Uncovering the underlying physical mechanism behind the event-to-event variability of $\alpha$ and $\theta$ in terms of catchment physical processes and rainfall properties would significantly improve our ability to predict peak-discharge in ungauged basins (PUB). The simulation results demonstrate how both $\alpha$ and $\theta$ are systematically controlled by the interplay among rainfall duration T, spatially averaged rainfall intensity E[I], as well as E[C r], E[vh], and vc. Specifically, we found that the value of $\theta$ generally decreases with increasing values of E[I], E[C r], and E[vh], whereas its value generally increases with increasing T. Moreover, while $\alpha$ is primarily controlled by E[I], it increases with increasing E[C r] and E[vh]. These results highlight the fact that the flood scaling parameters are able to be estimated from the aforementioned catchment rainfall and physical variables, which can be measured either directly or indirectly. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Hydrological distributed models demand large amounts of data, information and parameters in order to accurately represent the spatial variability of the main hydrological processes and inputs. The parameter estimation is always a complex and expensive task which is often unaffordable and therefore hydrologists are frequently forced to disregard distributed modelling in favour of lumped or semidistributed models. To solve this situation, we propose in this paper to split the effective parameter at each cell in two components: the hydrological characteristic (at point scale and maintaining its physical meaning) and a correction factor (common for all cells and taking into account all modelling errors including the temporal and spatial scale effects). The new split-parameter structure adopted in our distributed model (called TETIS) is coupled with the SCE-UA automatic optimization method in order to obtain the set of optimal correction factors of the model, without loosing the spatial variability described by the a priori estimated hydrological characteristics. Automatic procedures can be easily adapted to the split-parameter structure because the number of variables to be calibrated is dramatically reduced from thousands of cell parameters to a small number of common correction factors (one for each parameter map). Also, the optimum initial values of the state variables can be obtained automatically. In order to show the advantages of the new structure a real application is performed in a case study in which the calibration and the spatial and spatial-temporal validation processes have been carried out. The results can be considered as being excellent and it is concluded that automatic calibration with the SCE-UA algorithm has been shown to be reliable and fast. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The ERS Scatterometer is a C-band radar with a spatial resolution of 50 km and a high temporal sampling rate. An algorithm for estimating the surface soil moisture content is applied to 6 years of data. A qualitative comparison with meteorological observations and auxiliary information indicates that good-quality surface wetness values can be determined. A simple method is developed to relate the surface estimates with the profile soil moisture content. This model requires as input the remotely sensed radar data and soil data encompassing wilting level, field capacity, and porosity. The method was validated with an extensive data set of gravimetric soil moisture measurements in the 0-20 cm and 0-100 cm layers from the agrometeorological network in the Ukraine. It is found that the ERS Scatterometer data can be used to distinguish about five soil moisture levels with good confidence.},

abstract = {The analysis of Henderson and Wooding, 1964, is expanded in comparing simplified models of subsurface stormflow for the case of a sloping soil mantle in which the hydraulic conductivity is constant throughout. Reviewing studies both in the field and theoretical in nature, the process of subsurface stormflow apparently will be the dominant mode of hydrological response of a hillslope or catchment under the following conditions: soils of high permeability, whether inherent in the soil matrix or due to structural or biotic macropores; and a steep hydraulic gradient, whether due to the slope of hillslopes or to the buildup of groundwater mounds on shallow slopes. The magnitude and timing of the subsurface flow response will depend on the depth and hydraulic conditions of the unsaturated zone at the time of the storm. In this paper only the simplest possible conditions have been studied, with the unsaturated zone being neglected, and constant input to a soil of constant hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity throughout its depth being assumed. It has been shown using data from field and numerical studies of subsurface stormflow that the kinematic approximation may be appropriate for combinations of slope conditions and input rates of practical interest.

abstract = {In this study, a regional distributed hydrological model is used to perform long-term and flash-flood event simulations, over the C{\'{e}}vennes–Vivarais region (south of France). The objective is to improve our understanding on the role played by geology on the hydrological processes of catchments during two past flash-flood events. This modelling work is based on Vannier et al. (“Regional estimation of catchment-scale soil properties by means of streamflow recession analysis for use in distributed hydrological models”, Hydrological Processes, 2014), where streamflow recessions are analysed to estimate the thickness and hydraulic conductivity of weathered rock layers, depending on the geological nature of catchments. Weathered rock layers are thus implemented into the hydrological model CVN-p, and the contribution of these layers is assessed during flash-flood events simulations as well as during inter-event periods. The model is used without any calibration, to test hypotheses on the active hydrological processes. The results point out two different hydrological behaviours, depending on the geology: on crystalline rocks (granite and gneiss), the addition of a weathered rock layer considerably improves the simulated discharges, during flash-flood events as well as during recession periods, and makes the model able to remarkably reproduce the observed streamflow dynamics. For other geologies (schists especially), the benefits are real, but not sufficient to properly simulate the observed streamflow dynamics. These results probably underline the existence of poorly known processes (flow paths, non-linear spilling process) associated with the planar structure of schisty rocks. On a methodological point of view, this study proposes a simple way to account for the additional storage associated with each geological entity, through the addition of a weathered porous rock layer situated below the traditionally-considered upper soil horizons, and shows its applicability and benefits for the simulation of flash flood events at the regional scale.},

abstract = {Approximately one-third of the Earth's land surface is located in arid or semi-arid regions, often in areas suffering severely from the negative impacts of desertification and population pressure. Reliable hydrological forecasts across spatial and temporal scales are crucial to achieve water security, i.e. protection from excess and lack of water, for people and ecosystems in these areas. At short temporal scales, flash floods are extremely dangerous hazards accounting, for example, for more than 80{\%} of all flood-related deaths in the USA. Forecasting of these floods requires a connected spatially-distributed hydro-meteorological modelling system which accounts for the specific meteorological and hydrological characteristics of semi-arid watersheds, e.g. summertime convective rainfall and channel transmission losses. The spatially highly heterogeneous nature of the precipitation and the non-linear response behaviour of the system demand the explicit accounting and propagation of uncertainties into the model predictions. This short paper presents the results of a multi-year study in which such a system was developed for flash-flood forecasting in the semi-arid southwestern USA. In particular, we discuss our effort to understand and estimate underlying uncertainties in such a modelling system. To achieve this we use the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation framework approach to uncertainty analysis, in combination with a variance-based global sensitivity analysis technique. The system was tested using gauge and radar estimates of rainfall for eight summertime convective thunderstorm events in the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed near Tombstone, Arizona. In general, the level of uncertainty found was very high and largely dominated by uncertainty in the radar rainfall estimates. Regarding the model parameters, uncertainties in the hillslope model parameter values had a greater impact on the predictions than the uncertainties in the channel parameters, at least for relatively small basins.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {In northern Morocco are located most of the dams and reservoirs of the country, while this region is affected by severe rainfall events causing floods. To improve the management of the water regulation structures, there is a need to develop rainfall-runoff models to both maximize the storage capacity and reduce the risks caused by floods. In this study, a model is developed to reproduce the flood events for a 655 km2 catchment located upstream of the 6th largest dam in Morocco. Constrained by data availability, a standard event-based model combining a SCS-CN (Soil Conservation Service Curve Number) loss model and a Clark unit hydrograph was developed for hourly discharge simulation using 16 flood events that occurred between 1984 and 2008. The model was found satisfactory to reproduce the runoff and the temporal evolution of floods, even with limited rainfall data. Several antecedent wetness conditions estimators for the catchment were compared with the initial condition of the model. Theses estimators include an antecedent discharge index, an antecedent precipitation index and a continuous daily soil moisture accounting model (SMA), based on precipitation and evapotranspiration. The SMA model performed the best to estimate the initial conditions of the event-based hydrological model (R2 Combining double low line 0.9). Its daily output has been compared with ASCAT and AMSR-E remote sensing data products, which were both able to reproduce with accuracy the daily simulated soil moisture dynamics at the catchment scale. This same approach could be implemented in other catchments of this region for operational purposes. The Results of this study suggest that remote sensing data are potentially useful to estimate the soil moisture conditions in the case of ungauged catchments in Northern Africa. {\textcopyright} 2012 Author(s).},

abstract = {This contribution is one of the first studies about the regionalization of parameter sets for a rainfall-runoff model process-oriented and dedicated to flash floods. MARINE model performances are tested on a large database of 117 flash floods occurred during the last two decades in the French Mediterranean region. Given the scarcity of flash flood data, the dataset used in this study represents a large sample of hydrology and landscapes from Pyrenean, Mediterranean, C??vennes-Vivarais and Provence regions. Spatial proximity and similarity approaches with several combinations of descriptors are tested. Encouraging results are obtained with two similarity approaches based on physiographic descriptors with two and three donor catchments. There is only a small decrease of performance of 10{\%} from cal/val to regionalization for these two methods. For 13 catchments out of 16 there is at least one flood event simulated with rather good performance. This study highlights the importance of hydrological information that is available in calibration events for a gauged catchment and from donor catchment(s) for regionalization. Moreover it is found that regionalization is easier for catchments with an apparently more regular behaviour. The most sensitive parameter of MARINE model, C{\textless}inf{\textgreater}Z{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, controlling soil volume and water balance, is rather well constrained by the two similarity approaches thanks to bedrock descriptors.},

One of the problems of flash floods is that warning times are very short, leaving typically only a few hours for civil protection services to act.

Therefore, hydrological models are difficult to calibrate and the simulated river discharges cannot always be compared with ground measurements. The lack of observations in most flash flood prone basins, therefore, necessitates the development of a method where the excess of the simulated discharge above a critical threshold can provide the forecaster with an indication of potential flood hazard in the area, with lead times of the order of weather forecasts. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} This study is focused on the C{\'{e}}vennes-Vivarais region in the Southeast of the Massif Central in France, a region known for devastating flash floods.

abstract = {Flash floods are one of the most significant natural hazards in Europe, causing serious risk to life and destruction of buildings and infrastructure. This type of flood, often affecting ungauged watersheds, remains nevertheless a poorly documented phenomenon. To address the gap in available information, and particularly to assess the possible ranges for peak discharges on watersheds with area smaller than 500 km2 and to describe the geography of the hazard across Europe, an intensive data compilation has been carried out for seven European hydrometeorological regions. This inventory is the first step towards an atlas of extreme flash floods in Europe. It contains over 550 documented events. This paper aims at presenting the data compilation strategy, the content of the elaborated data base and some preliminary data analysis results. The initial observations show that the most extreme flash floods are greater in magnitude in the Mediterranean countries than in the inner continental countries and that there is a strong seasonality to flash flood occurrence revealing different climatic forcing mechanisms in each region. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A physically based distributed slope stability model is described that utilizes a combined surface–subsurface kinematic wave module to assess groundwater fluctuations related to slope stability. A total of 82 major rainstorms from 1972 to 1990 in Carnation Creek, British Columbia, were examined to determine the influence of different characteristics of rainstorms (such as mean and maximum hourly intensity, duration, and rainfall amount) on the slope stability. These rainstorms vary in mean intensity from 1{\textperiodcentered}6 to 11{\textperiodcentered}2 mm h−1, storm duration from 11 to 93 h, and maximum hourly intensity from 3{\textperiodcentered}4 to 35 mm h−1. Four synthetic ‘uniform intensity' rainstorms were also tested against real storms to assess the effect of short-term hourly rainfall intensity peaks on landslide occurrence. Altogether, 602 simulations were conducted. The combined influence of mean and maximum hourly intensity, duration, and total rainfall amount of rainstorms were important in generating landslides. The temporal distribution of short-term intensity also influenced the landslide occurrence. When saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil was lowered or soil depth was raised, most rainstorms produced larger numbers of landslides. For the most part, actual rainstorms produced less stable conditions than their synthetic ‘uniform intensity' counterparts. For all landslide-producing storms, slope failure usually occurred after some threshold of cumulative rainfall and maximum hourly rainfall intensity. These simulations provide insights into the distributed behaviour of landslide occurrence during large rainstorms with varying characteristics.

abstract = {Flash floods represent one of the most destructive natural hazards in the Mediterranean region. These floods result from very intense and spatially heterogeneous rainfall events. Distributed hydrological models are valuable tools to study these phenomena and increase our knowledge on the main processes governing the generation and propagation of floods over large spatial scales. They are generally built using a bottom???up approach that generalizes small-physics representations of processes. However, top???down or data-driven approach is increasingly shown to provide also valuable knowledge. A simplified semi-distributed continuous hydrological model, named SIMPLEFLOOD, was developed, based on the simple dynamical system approach (SDSA) proposed by Kirchner (WRR, 2009, 45, W02429), and applied to the Ard??che catchment in France (2388 km2). This data-driven method assumes that discharge at the outlet of a given catchment can be expressed as a function only of catchment storage. It leads to a 3-parameter nonlinear model according to rainfall and runoff observations. This model was distributed over sub-catchments and coupled with a kinematic wave based flow propagation module. The parameters were estimated by discharge recession analyses at several gauged stations. Parameter regionalization was conducted using a Factorial Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD) and Hierarchical Classification on Principal Component (HCPC) in order to find relationships between the SDSA approach and catchments characteristics. Geology was found to be the main predictor of hydrological response variability and model parameters were regionalized according to the dominant geology. The SIMPLEFLOOD model was applied for a 12-year continuous simulation over the Ard??che catchment. Four flash flood events were also selected for further analysis. The simulated hydrographs were compared with the observations at 11 gauging stations with catchment size ranging from 17 to 2300 km2. The results show a good performance of the model for the continuous and flash flood events occurring under wet conditions, whereas the model underestimates discharge for events occurring after a long dry period. The simple modeling approach provided interesting insight into the Ard??che catchment functioning and offers perspective for a better simulation of flash floods, mainly under wet conditions.},

abstract = {Ephemeral streams are typical Mediterranean fluvial systems with high risk of flash flooding, and few data are available about these systems in most locales. However, the SAIH network (Automatic Hydrological Information Systems) of the Jucar River Water Authority has been providing detailed information about ephemeral streams in Spain every 5min since 1988. Using these data, we evaluated the processes of rainfall-runoff conversion and flood generation in five Mediterranean ephemeral streams ranging in size from 25 to 450km2. To provide a general framework for hydrological analysis, the study included 142 flash flood events registered between 1989 and 2007. A more detailed analysis was conducted for the Carraixet Basin under the dry antecedent moisture condition (AMC I) to evaluate the influence of rainfall on the basin's response. A simple index called Momentum of Maximum Intensity (MMI) was developed to describe the influence of rainfall intensity on hydrograph. Correlations between the main indicators of precipitation and flow also were assessed. Results showed that flash floods were generally generated by average accumulated rainfall of around 100mm at high intensities that could exceed 300mm/h. Initial abstractions and average water losses during the rainfall-runoff conversion processes were very important (runoff coefficients of 6{\%} and runoff thresholds of 62mm). No correlation was found between initial abstractions (Ia ) calculated from the basin characteristics and runoff thresholds (P 0) empirically obtained, which create some doubts about the validity of Ia method for predicting floods in ephemeral streams. Accumulated rainfall was very important for flood volume, peak flow and water balance indicators, whereas intensity indicators were more related to the response times of the basins. Rainfall intensity variables influenced lag time. Accumulated rainfall, in combination with high reduced mean intensity and low persistence, were a good predictor for high peak flow. Finally, the analysis revealed two types of events. The first type, typical of summer and early autumn, consists of fast events characterized by intense rainfall concentrated at the beginning of the storm and high values of persistence and irregularity. The basin responds quickly and generates hydrographs that resemble the pattern of rain. The second type, representative of winter and spring, corresponds to less intense events. Although they accumulate more rain, maximum intensities are lower and occur at the end of the episode. The response of the basin is late, and hydrographs are quite different from hyetographs and very influenced by the basin.},

Results from an existing automated digital filter technique for separating baseflow from daily streamflow records were compared to baseflow estimates made in the six water balance studies. Previous validation of automated baseflow separation techniques consisted only of comparisons with manual techniques. In this study, the automated digital filter technique was found to compare well with measured field estimates yielding a monthly coefficient of determination of 0.86. The recharge algorithm developed in this study is an automated derivation of the Rorabaugh hydrograph recession curve displacement method that utilizes daily streamflow. Comparison of annual recharge from field water balance measurements to those computed with the automated recession curve displacement method had coefficients of determination of 0.76 and predictive efficiencies of 71 percent. Monthly estimates showed more variation and are not advocated for use with this method. These techniques appear to be fast, reproducible methods for estimating baseflow and annual recharge and should be useful in regional modeling efforts and as a quick check on mass balance techniques for shallow water table aquifers.},

In an attempt to overcome this problem we have combined archival records, dendrogeomorphic time series and instrumental data (daily rainfall and discharge) from four ungauged and poorly gauged mountain basins in Central Spain with the aim of reconstructing and compiling information on 41 flash flood events since the end of the 19th century. Estimation of historical discharge and the incorporation of uncertainty for the at-site and regional flood frequency analysis were performed with an empirical rainfall-runoff assessment as well as stochastic and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches. Results for each of the ungauged basins include flood frequency, severity, seasonality and triggers (synoptic meteorological situations). The reconstructed data series clearly demonstrates how uncertainty can be reduced by including historical information, but also points to the considerable influence of different approaches on quantile estimation. This uncertainty should be taken into account when these data are used for flood risk management. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The village of Pajares de Pedraza (Segovia, Spain) is located in the floodplain of the Cega River, a left bank tributary of the Douro River. Repeated flash flood events occur in this small village because of its upstream catchment area, mountainous character and impermeable lithology, which reduce concentration time to just a few hours. River overbank flow has frequently caused flooding and property damage to homes and rural properties, most notably in 1927, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2013 and 2014. Consequently, a detailed analysis was carried out to quantify the economic risk of flash floods in peri-urban and rural areas. Magnitudes and exceedance probabilities were obtained from a flood frequency analysis of maximum discharges. To determine the extent and characteristics of the flooded area, we performed 2D hydraulic modeling (Iber 2.0 software) based on LIDAR (1 m) topography and considering three different scenarios associated with the initial construction (1997) and subsequent extension (2013) of a linear defense structure (rockfill dike or levee) to protect the population. Specific stage???damage functions were expressly developed using in situ data collection for exposed elements, with special emphasis on urban-type categories. The average number of elements and their unit value were established. The relationship between water depth and the height at which electric outlets, furniture, household goods, etc. were located was analyzed; due to its effect on the form of the function. Other nonspecific magnitude???damage functions were used in order to compare both economic estimates. The results indicate that the use of non-specific magnitude???damage functions leads to a significant overestimation of economic losses, partly linked to the use of general economic cost data. Furthermore, a detailed classification and financial assessment of exposed assets is the most important step to ensure a correct estimate of financial losses. In both cases, this should include a consideration of the socio-economic and cultural conditions prevailing in the area, as well as the types of flood that affect it.},

abstract = {Landslides are a main cause of human and economic losses worldwide. For this reason, landslide hazard assessment and the capacity to predict this phenomenon have been topics of great interest within the scientific community for the implementation of early warning systems. Although several models have been proposed to forecast shallow landslides triggered by rainfall, few models have incorporated geotechnical factors into a complete hydrological model of a basin that can simulate the storage and movement of rainwater through the soil profile. These basin and full hydrological models have adopted a physically based approach. This paper develops a conceptual and physically based model called open and distributed hydrological simulation and landslides—SHIA{\_}Landslide (Simulaci{\'{o}}n HIdrol{\'{o}}gica Abierta, or SHIA, in Spanish)—that is supported by geotechnical and hydrological features occurring on a basin-wide scale in tropical and mountainous terrains. SHIA{\_}Landslide is an original and significant contribution that offers a new perspective with which to analyse shallow landslide processes by incorporating a comprehensive distributed hydrological tank model that includes water storage in the soil coupled with a classical analysis of infinite slope stability under saturated conditions. SHIA{\_}Landslide can be distinguished by the following: (i) its capacity to capture surface topography and effects concerning the subsurface flow; (ii) its use of digital terrain model (DTM) to establish the relationships among cells, geomorphological parameters, slope angle, direction, etc.; (iii) its continuous simulation of rainfall data over long periods and event simulations of specific storms; (iv) its consideration of the effects of horizontal and vertical flow; and (vi) its inclusion of a hydrologically complete water process that allows for hydrological calibration. SHIA{\_}Landslide can be combined with real-time rainfall data and implemented in early warning systems.},

The possibility of such models raises questions about system design requirements to allow modelling as a learning and data assimilation process in the representation of places, which might well be treated as active objects in such a system. Uncertainty in model predictions not only poses issues about the value of different types of data in characterising places and constraining predictive uncertainty but also about how best to present the pedigree of such uncertain predictions to users and decision-makers.},

abstract = {Programmes to promote water-related research are expanding rapidly around the globe. Whereas many have unique mission and objectives, several share common and overlapping goals and have areas of potential intersection. Identifying overlap between initia- tives allows recognition of potential linkages and areas where the programmes complement each other. This allows each programme to retain its focus while ensuring that the combined programmes cover all the important issues concerning sustainable drainage-basin man- agement. The objective of this commentary is to describe the areas of intersection between three international water research efforts and to explore synergies between them. We start by describing the evolution of the two UNESCO activities (FRIEND and HELP) and the new initiative of the International Association of Hydrologi- cal Sciences (IAHS) called PUB. We then explore possible areas of intersection among FRIEND, HELP and PUB and list the hitherto unrealized opportunities for research that would add value to each programme and, consequently, hydrological sciences and integrated drainage-basin management. We end by defining tangible activities that can be accomplished in the next 1–5 years.},

Tests on one month of data from one site show that the algorithms perform accurately and provide products that characterize the essential features of the precipitation climatology. Input to the algorithms are the operationally executed volume scans of a radar and the data from a surrounding rain gauge network. The algorithms separate the radar echoes into convective and stratiform regions, statistically summarize the vertical structure of the radar echoes, and determine precipitation rates and amounts on high spatial resolution. The convective and stratiform regions are separated on the basis of the intensity and sharpness of the peaks of echo intensity. The peaks indicate the centers of the convective region. Precipitation not identified as convective is stratiform. This method avoids the problem of underestimating the stratiform precipitation. The separation criteria are...},

abstract = {The separation of storm hydrographs using stable isotope tracers dates back to the late 1960s. These studies ushered in a paradigm shift in how hydrologists conceptualized runoff generation as most showed a large preponderance of pre-event water in the storm hydrograph, even at peak flow. This forced a fundamental re-examination of the processes of water delivery to streams during rainfall and snowmelt events. Whilst the simplicity of the two-component hydrograph separation was a powerful tool for showing the importance of stored water effusion, the assumptions implicit in the two-component model have now become limiting for further advancement of the approach. Here we review the use of stable isotopes for hydrograph separation with particular reference to studies completed since the last comprehensive review of the subject in 1994. We review critically the contributions to new field knowledge gained by isotope hydrograph separation applications. We focus specifically on the current issues regarding the limitations of the two-component approach. We examine the role of soil water as a contributor to channel stormflow and the issues raised by differences in the soil water and groundwater signatures at the watershed scale. Finally, we offer ideas on how to overcome the limitations of the two-component approach and present a vision for future directions for isotope based hydrograph separation. These future directions are focused on high frequency analysis of rainfall-runoff structures and dual isotope analysis of catchment end-members including comparison of lysimeter-based soil water sampling of mobile soil water versus cryogenic and vapor-based analysis of tightly bound water. ?? 2013 .},

abstract = {The estimation of catchment-scale soil properties, such as water storage capacity and hydraulic conductivity, is of primary interest for the implementation of distributed hydrological models at the regional scale. This estimation is generally performed on the basis of information provided by soil databases. However, such databases are often established for agronomic uses and generally do not document deep-weathered rock horizons (i.e. pedologic horizons of type C and deeper), which can play a major role in water transfer and storages. Here, we define the Drainable Storage Capacity Index (DSCI), an indicator that relies on the comparison between cumulated streamflow and precipitation to assess catchment-scale storage capacities. DSCI is found to be reliable to detect underestimation of soil storage capacities in soil databases. We also use the streamflow recession analysis methodology defined by Brutsaert and Nieber in 1977 to estimate water storage capacities and lateral saturated hydraulic conductivities of the nondocumented deep horizons. The analysis is applied to a sample of 23 catchments (0.2-291km(2)) located in the Cevennes-Vivarais region (south of France). For regionalization purposes, the obtained results are compared with the dominant catchment geology and present a clear hierarchy between the different geologies of the area. Hard crystalline rocks are found to be associated with the thickest and less conductive deep soil horizons. Schist rocks present intermediate values of thickness and of saturated hydraulic conductivity, whereas sedimentary rocks and alluvium are found to be less thick and most conductive. These results are of primary interest in view of the future set-up of distributed hydrological models over the Cevennes-Vivarais region. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The availability of in situ measurements of precipitation in remote locations is limited. As a result, the use of satellite measurements of precipitation is attractive for water resources management. Combined precipitation products that rely partially or entirely on satellite measurements are becoming increasingly available. However, these products have several weaknesses, for example their failure to capture certain types of precipitation, limited accuracy and limited spatial and temporal resolution. This paper evaluates the usefulness of several commonly used precipitation products over data scarce, complex mountainous terrain from a water resources perspective. Spatially averaged precipitation time series were generated or obtained for 16 sub-basins of the Paute river basin in the Ecuadorian Andes and 13 sub-basins of the Baker river basin in Chilean Patagonia. Precipitation time series were generated using the European Centre for Medium Weather Range Forecasting (ECMWF) 40year reanalysis (ERA-40) and the subsequent ERA-interim products, and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis dataset 1 (NCEP R1) hindcast products, as well as precipitation estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN). The Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) 3B42 is also used for the Ecuadorian Andes. These datasets were compared to both spatially averaged gauged precipitation and river discharge. In general, the time series of the remotely sensed and hindcast products show a low correlation with locally observed precipitation data. Large biases are also observed between the different products. Hydrological verification based on river flows reveals that water balance errors can be extremely high for all evaluated products, including interpolated local data, in basins smaller than 1000km2. The observations are consistent over the two study regions despite very different climatic settings and hydrological processes, which is encouraging for extrapolation to other mountainous regions. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Hydrological distributed models demand large amounts of data, information and parameters in order to accurately represent the spatial variability of the main hydrological processes and inputs. The parameter estimation is always a complex and expensive task which is often unaffordable and therefore hydrologists are frequently forced to disregard distributed modelling in favour of lumped or semidistributed models. To solve this situation, we propose in this paper to split the effective parameter at each cell in two components: the hydrological characteristic (at point scale and maintaining its physical meaning) and a correction factor (common for all cells and taking into account all modelling errors including the temporal and spatial scale effects). The new split-parameter structure adopted in our distributed model (called TETIS) is coupled with the SCE-UA automatic optimization method in order to obtain the set of optimal correction factors of the model, without loosing the spatial variability described by the a priori estimated hydrological characteristics. Automatic procedures can be easily adapted to the split-parameter structure because the number of variables to be calibrated is dramatically reduced from thousands of cell parameters to a small number of common correction factors (one for each parameter map). Also, the optimum initial values of the state variables can be obtained automatically. In order to show the advantages of the new structure a real application is performed in a case study in which the calibration and the spatial and spatial-temporal validation processes have been carried out. The results can be considered as being excellent and it is concluded that automatic calibration with the SCE-UA algorithm has been shown to be reliable and fast. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Estimation of rainfall intensity-duration thresholds, used for the identification of debris flow/landslide triggering rainfall events, has been traditionally based on raingauge observations. The main drawback of using information from gauges is that the measurement stations are usually located far away from the debris flow initiation areas. In complex terrain where debris flows take place, the spatial variability of rainfall can be very high and this translates in large uncertainty of raingauge-based estimates of debris flow triggering rainfall. This work focuses on the assessment of the impact of rainfall estimation uncertainty on identification and use of rainfall thresholds for debris flow occurrence. The Upper Adige River basin, Northern Italy, is the area of study. A detailed database of more than 400 identified debris flow initiation points during the period 2000-2010 and a raingauge network of 100 stations comprise the database used for this work. The methodology examines the intensity-duration thresholds derived from a set of raingauges that are assumed to be located at debris flow initiation points (DFRs) and an equivalent set of raingauges assumed to have the role of the closest (to debris flow) available measurement (MRs). A set of reference rainfall thresholds is used to identify the rainfall events at DFRs that "triggered" debris flows (i.e. exceed the threshold). For these same events, the corresponding rainfall thresholds are derived from MR observations. Comparison between the rainfall thresholds derived from DFRs and MRs revealed that uncertainty in rainfall estimation has a major impact on estimated intensity-duration thresholds. Specifically, the results showed that thresholds estimated from MR observations are consistently underestimated. Evaluation of the estimated thresholds for warning procedures showed that while detection is high, the main issue is the high false alarm ratio, which limits the overall accuracy of the procedure. Overall performance on debris flow prediction was shown to be good for low rainfall thresholds and poor for high rainfall thresholds examined. Lastly, it was found that filtering out rainfall events with duration {\textless}. 12. h may improve bias in estimated thresholds and performance for high rainfall thresholds. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The ERS Scatterometer is a C-band radar with a spatial resolution of 50 km and a high temporal sampling rate. An algorithm for estimating the surface soil moisture content is applied to 6 years of data. A qualitative comparison with meteorological observations and auxiliary information indicates that good-quality surface wetness values can be determined. A simple method is developed to relate the surface estimates with the profile soil moisture content. This model requires as input the remotely sensed radar data and soil data encompassing wilting level, field capacity, and porosity. The method was validated with an extensive data set of gravimetric soil moisture measurements in the 0-20 cm and 0-100 cm layers from the agrometeorological network in the Ukraine. It is found that the ERS Scatterometer data can be used to distinguish about five soil moisture levels with good confidence.},

abstract = {Two recent studies have suggested that neural net- work modelling offers no worthwhile improvements in com- parison to the application of weighted linear transfer func- tions for capturing the non-linear nature of hydrological re- lationships. The potential of an artificial neural network to perform simple non-linear hydrological transformations un- der controlled conditions is examined in this paper. Eight neural network models were developed: four full or partial emulations of a recognised non-linear hydrological rainfall- runoff model; four solutions developed on an identical set of inputs and a calculated runoff coefficient output. The use of different input combinations enabled the competencies of solutions developed on a reduced number of parameters to be assessed. The selected hydrological model had a limited number of inputs and contained no temporal component. The modelling process was based on a set of random inputs that had a uniform distribution and spanned a modest range of possibilities. The initial cloning operations permitted a direct comparison to be performed with the equation-based rela- tionship. It also provided more general information about the power of a neural network to replicate mathematical equa- tions and model modest non-linear relationships. The sec- ond group of experiments explored a different relationship that is of hydrological interest; the target surface contained a stronger set of non-linear properties and was more challeng- ing. Linear modelling comparisons were performed against traditional least squares multiple linear regression solutions developed on identical datasets. The reported results demon- strate that neural networks are capable of modelling non- linear hydrological processes and are therefore appropriate tools for hydrological modelling},

@article{Norbiato2008,
abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to evaluate a threshold-based flash flood warning method, by considering a wide range of climatic and physiographic conditions, and by focusing on ungauged basins. The method is derived from the flash flood guidance (FFG, hereafter) approach. The FFG is the depth of rain of a given duration, taken as uniform in space and time on a certain basin, necessary to cause minor flooding at the outlet of the considered basin. This rainfall depth, which is computed based on a hydrological model, is compared to either real-time-observed or forecasted rainfall of the same duration and on the same basin. If the nowcasted or forecasted rainfall depth is greater than the FFG, then flooding in the basin is considered likely. The study provides an assessment of this technique based on operational quality data from 11 mountainous basins (six nested included in five larger parent basins) located in north-eastern Italy and central France. The model used in this study is a semi-distributed conceptual rainfall-runoff model, following the structure of the PDM (probability distributed moisture) model. Two general questions are addressed: (1) How does the efficiency of the method evolve when the simulation parameters can not be calibrated but must be transposed from parent gauged basins to ungauged basins? (2) How sensitive are the results to the method used to estimate the initial soil moisture status? System performances are evaluated by means of categorical statistics, such as the critical success index (CSI). Results show that overall CSI is equal to 0.43 for the parent basins, where the hydrological model has been calibrated. CSI reduces to 0.28 for the interior basins, when model parameters are transposed from parent basins, and to 0.21, when both model parameters and soil moisture status is transposed from parent basins. Performance differences between FFG and use of time-constant soil moisture status are very high for the parent basins and decrease with decreasing the system accuracy. The percent difference amounts to 53{\%} for the parent basins, to 25{\%} for interior basins with parameter transposition, and to 19{\%} for interior basins with parameter and soil moisture status transposition. These results improve our understanding of the applicability and reliability of this method at various scales and under various scenarios of data availability. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This contribution is one of the first studies about the regionalization of parameter sets for a rainfall-runoff model process-oriented and dedicated to flash floods. MARINE model performances are tested on a large database of 117 flash floods occurred during the last two decades in the French Mediterranean region. Given the scarcity of flash flood data, the dataset used in this study represents a large sample of hydrology and landscapes from Pyrenean, Mediterranean, C??vennes-Vivarais and Provence regions. Spatial proximity and similarity approaches with several combinations of descriptors are tested. Encouraging results are obtained with two similarity approaches based on physiographic descriptors with two and three donor catchments. There is only a small decrease of performance of 10{\%} from cal/val to regionalization for these two methods. For 13 catchments out of 16 there is at least one flood event simulated with rather good performance. This study highlights the importance of hydrological information that is available in calibration events for a gauged catchment and from donor catchment(s) for regionalization. Moreover it is found that regionalization is easier for catchments with an apparently more regular behaviour. The most sensitive parameter of MARINE model, C{\textless}inf{\textgreater}Z{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, controlling soil volume and water balance, is rather well constrained by the two similarity approaches thanks to bedrock descriptors.},

@article{Zehe2008a,
abstract = {In this paper we review threshold behaviour in environmental systems, which are often associated with the onset of floods, contamination and erosion events, and other degenerative processes. Key objectives of this review are to a) suggest indicators for detecting threshold behavior, b) discuss their implications for predictability, c) distinguish different forms of threshold behavior and their underlying controls, and d) hypothesise on possible reasons for why threshold behaviour might occur. Threshold behaviour involves a fast qualitative change of either a single process or the response of a system. For elementary phenomena this switch occurs when boundary conditions (e.g., energy inputs) or system states as expressed by dimensionless quantities (e.g. the Reynolds number) exceed threshold values. Mixing, water movement or depletion of thermodynamic gradients becomes much more efficient as a result. Intermittency is a very good indicator for detecting event scale threshold behavior in hydrological systems. Predictability of intermittent processes/system responses is inherently low for combinations of systems states and/or boundary conditions that push the system close to a threshold. Post hoc identification of `cause-effect relations' to explain when the system became critical is inherently difficult because of our limited ability to perform observations under controlled identical experimental conditions. In this review, we distinguish three forms of threshold behavior. The first one is threshold behavior at the process level that is controlled by the interplay of local soil characteristics and states, vegetation and the rainfall forcing. Overland flow formation, particle detachment and preferential flow are examples of this. The second form of threshold behaviour is the response of systems of intermediate complexity - e.g., catchment runoff response and sediment yield - governed by the redistribution of water and sediments in space and time. These are controlled by the topological architecture of the catchments that interacts with system states and the boundary conditions. Crossing the response thresholds means to establish connectedness of surface or subsurface flow paths to the catchment outlet. Subsurface stormflow in humid areas, overland flow and erosion in semi-arid and arid areas are examples, and explain that crossing local process thresholds is necessary but not sufficient to trigger a system response threshold. The third form of threshold behaviour involves changes in the `architecture' of human geo-ecosystems, which experience various disturbances. As a result substantial change in hydrological functioning of a system is induced, when the disturbances exceed the resilience of the geo-ecosystem. We present examples from savannah ecosystems, humid agricultural systems, mining activities affecting rainfall runoff in forested areas, badlands formation in Spain, and the restoration of the Upper Rhine river basin as examples of this phenomenon. This functional threshold behaviour is most difficult to predict, since it requires extrapolations far away from our usual experience and the accounting of bidirectional feedbacks. However, it does not require the development of more complicated model, but on the contrary, only models with the right level of simplification, which we illustrate with an instructive example. Following Prigogine, who studied structure formation in open thermodynamic systems, we hypothesise that topological structures which control response thresholds in the landscape might be seen as dissipative structures, nd the onset of threshold processes/response as a switch to more efficient ways of depleting strong gradients that develop in the case of extreme boundary conditions.},

Consequently, the atmospheric, hydrological and geomorphic controls on these hydrogeomorphic processes are poorly understood, leading to highly uncertain warning and risk management. On the other hand, remote sensing of precipitation and numerical weather predictions have become the basis of several flood forecasting systems, enabling increasingly accurate detection of hazardous events. The objective of this paper is to provide a review on current European and international research on early warning systems for flash floods and debris flows. We expand upon these themes by identifying: (a) the state of the art; (b) knowledge gaps; and (c) suggested research directions to advance warning capabilities for extreme hydrogeomorphic processes. We also suggest three areas in which advancements in science will have immediate and important practical consequence, namely development of rainfall estimation and nowcasting schemes suited to the specific space-time scales, consolidating physical, engineering and social datasets of flash floods and debris-flows, integration of methods for multiple hydrogeomorphic hazard warning.},

abstract = {A framework for a comprehensive synthetic rainfall-runoff database was developed to study catchment response to a variety of rainfall events. The framework supports effective flood risk assessment and management and implements simple approaches. It consists of three flexible components, a rainfall generator, a continuous rainfallrunoff model, and a database management system. The system was developed and tested at two gauged river sections along the upper Tiber River (central Italy). One of the main questions was to investigate how simple such approaches can be applied without impairing the quality of the results. The rainfall-runoff model was used to simulate runoff on the basis of a large number of rainfall events. The resulting rainfallrunoff database stores pre-simulated events classified on the basis of the rainfall amount, initial wetness conditions and initial discharge. The real-time operational forecasts follow an analogue method that does not need new model simulations. However, the forecasts are based on the simulation results available in the rainfall-runoff database (for the specific class to which the forecast belongs). Therefore, the database can be used as an effective tool to assess possible streamflow scenarios assuming different rainfall volumes for the following days. The application to the study site shows that magnitudes of real flood events were appropriately captured by the database. Further work should be dedicated to introduce a component for taking account of the actual temporal distribution of rainfall events into the stochastic rainfall generator and to the use of different rainfall-runoff models to enhance the usability of the proposed procedure. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2013.},

abstract = {Just as with the storms that cause them, flash floods are highly variable and non-linear phenomena in both time and space; hence understanding and anticipating the genesis of flash floods is far from straightforward. There is therefore a huge requirement for tools with the potential to provide advance warning of situations likely to lead to flash floods, and thus provide additional time for the flood forecasting services. The Flash Flood Guidance (FFG) method is used on US catchments to estimate the average number of inches of rainfall for given durations required to produce flash flooding. This rainfall amount is used afterwards as a flood warning threshold. In Europe, flash floods often occur on small catchments (approximately 100 km2) and it has already been shown that the spatial variability of rainfall has a great impact on the catchment response (Le Lay and Saulnier, 2007). Therefore, in this study, an improved FFG method which accounts for rainfall spatial variability is proposed. The objectives of this paper are (i) to assess the FFG method applicability on French Mediterranean catchments with a distributed process-oriented hydrological model and (ii) to assess the effect of the rainfall spatial variability on this method. The results confirm the influence of the spatial variability of rainfall events in relation with its interaction with soil properties.},

abstract = {Flash floods cause some of the most severe natural disasters in Europe but Mediterranean areas are especially vulnerable. They can cause devastating damage to property, infrastructures and loss of human life. The complexity of flash flood generation processes and their dependency on different factors related to watershed properties and rainfall characteristics make flash flood prediction a difficult task. In this study, as part of the EU-FLASH project, we used an uncalibrated hydrological model to simulate flow events in a 27km2 Mediterranean watershed in Israel to analyze and better understand the various factors influencing flows. The model is based on the well-known SCS curve number method for rainfall-runoff calculations and on the kinematic wave method for flow routing. Existing data available from maps, GIS and field studies were used to define model parameters, and no further calibration was conducted to obtain a better fit between computed and observed flow data. The model rainfall input was obtained from the high temporal and spatial resolution radar data adjusted to rain gauges. Twenty flow events that occurred within the study area over a 15year period were analyzed. The model shows a generally good capability in predicting flash flood peak discharge in terms of their general level, classified as low, medium or high (all high level events were correctly predicted). It was found that the model mainly well predicts flash floods generated by intense, short-lived convective storm events while model performances for low and moderate flows generated by more widespread winter storms were quite poor. The degree of urban development was found to have a large impact on runoff amount and peak discharge, with higher sensitivity of moderate and low flow events relative to high flows. Flash flood generation was also found to be very sensitive to the temporal distribution of rain intensity within a specific storm event. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This study presents an application of an inno- vative sampling strategy to assess soil moisture dynamics in a headwater of the Wei{\ss}eritz in the German eastern Ore Mountains. A grassland site and a forested site were in- strumented with two Spatial TDR clusters (STDR) that con- sist of 39 and 32 coated TDR probes of 60cm length. Dis- tributed time series of vertically averaged soil moisture data from both sites/ensembles were analyzed by statistical and geostatistical methods. Spatial variability and the spatial mean at the forested site were larger than at the grassland site. Furthermore, clustering of TDR probes in combination with long-term monitoring allowed identification of average spatial covariance structures at the small field scale for dif- ferent wetness states. The correlation length of soil water content as well as the sill to nugget ratio at the grassland site increased with increasing average wetness and but, in contrast, were constant at the forested site. As soil proper- ties at both the forested and grassland sites are extremely variable, this suggests that the correlation structure at the forested site is dominated by the pattern of throughfall and interception. We also found a very strong correlation be- tween antecedent soil moisture at the forested site and runoff coefficients of rainfall-runoff events observed at gauge Rehe- feld. Antecedent soil moisture at the forest site explains 92{\%} of the variability in the runoff coefficients. By combining these results with a recession analysis we derived a first con- ceptual model of the dominant runoff mechanisms operating in this catchment. Finally, we employed a physically based hydrological model to shed light on the controls of soil- and plant morphological parameters on soil average soil moisture at the forested site and the grassland site, respectively. A homogeneous soil setup allowed, after fine tuning of plant morphological parameters, most of the time unbiased predic- tions of the observed average soil conditions observed at both field sites. We conclude that the proposed sampling strategy of clustering TDR probes is suitable to assess unbiased aver- age soil moisture dynamics in critical functional units, in this case the forested site, which is a much better predictor for event scale runoff formation than pre-event discharge. Long term monitoring of such critical landscape elements could maybe yield valuable information for flood warning in head- waters. We thus think that STDR provides a good intersect of the advantages of permanent sampling and spatially highly resolved soil moisture sampling using mobile rods.},

Several extreme events occurred in Slovenia (Europe) in the last 25. years that caused 18 casualties and approximately 500. million Euros of economic loss. The intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) relationship was constructed using the Frank copula function for several rainfall stations using high-resolution rainfall data with an average subsample length of 34. years. The empirical rainfall threshold curves were also evaluated for selected extreme events. Post-event analyses showed that rainfall characteristics triggering flash floods and landslides are different. The sensitivity analysis results indicate that the inter-event time definition (IETD) and subsample definition methodology can have a significant influence on the position of rainfall events in the intensity-duration space, the constructed IDF curves and on the relationship between the empirical rainfall threshold curves and the IDF curves constructed using the copula approach. Furthermore, a combination of several empirical rainfall thresholds with an appropriate high-density rainfall measurement network can be used as part of the early warning system of the initiation of landslides and debris flows. However, different rainfall threshold curves should be used for lowland and mountainous areas in Slovenia.},

abstract = {Ephemeral streams are typical Mediterranean fluvial systems with high risk of flash flooding, and few data are available about these systems in most locales. However, the SAIH network (Automatic Hydrological Information Systems) of the Jucar River Water Authority has been providing detailed information about ephemeral streams in Spain every 5min since 1988. Using these data, we evaluated the processes of rainfall-runoff conversion and flood generation in five Mediterranean ephemeral streams ranging in size from 25 to 450km2. To provide a general framework for hydrological analysis, the study included 142 flash flood events registered between 1989 and 2007. A more detailed analysis was conducted for the Carraixet Basin under the dry antecedent moisture condition (AMC I) to evaluate the influence of rainfall on the basin's response. A simple index called Momentum of Maximum Intensity (MMI) was developed to describe the influence of rainfall intensity on hydrograph. Correlations between the main indicators of precipitation and flow also were assessed. Results showed that flash floods were generally generated by average accumulated rainfall of around 100mm at high intensities that could exceed 300mm/h. Initial abstractions and average water losses during the rainfall-runoff conversion processes were very important (runoff coefficients of 6{\%} and runoff thresholds of 62mm). No correlation was found between initial abstractions (Ia ) calculated from the basin characteristics and runoff thresholds (P 0) empirically obtained, which create some doubts about the validity of Ia method for predicting floods in ephemeral streams. Accumulated rainfall was very important for flood volume, peak flow and water balance indicators, whereas intensity indicators were more related to the response times of the basins. Rainfall intensity variables influenced lag time. Accumulated rainfall, in combination with high reduced mean intensity and low persistence, were a good predictor for high peak flow. Finally, the analysis revealed two types of events. The first type, typical of summer and early autumn, consists of fast events characterized by intense rainfall concentrated at the beginning of the storm and high values of persistence and irregularity. The basin responds quickly and generates hydrographs that resemble the pattern of rain. The second type, representative of winter and spring, corresponds to less intense events. Although they accumulate more rain, maximum intensities are lower and occur at the end of the episode. The response of the basin is late, and hydrographs are quite different from hyetographs and very influenced by the basin.},

abstract = {This paper concerns the analysis of the 1 October 2009 flash flood and debris flow event caused by a very intense rainfall concentrated over the Messina area. The storm caused severe flash floods in many villages around the city of Messina, such as Giampilieri, Scaletta Zanclea, Altolia Superiore and Molino, with 38 casualties and significant damages to property, buildings, roads and bridges estimated close to 550 million Euro. The main focus of this work is to perform a post event analysis, putting together available meteorological and hydrological data in order to get better insight into temporal and spatial variability of the rain storm, the soil moisture conditions and the consequent flash flood in the Giampilieri catchment. The event was investigated using observed data from a raingauge network. Statistical analysis using GEV distribution was performed and rainfall return period (storm severity) was estimated. Further, measured rainfall data and rainfall-runoff modelling were used to estimate soil moisture conditions, to analyse the hydrological behaviour and to reconstruct flood hydrograph. With the help of GIS technology and particularly spatial analysis, the volume of debris which has gone down into the Giampilieri village was also calculated. GIS maps with landslide and material deposit areas were produced and analysed.},

abstract = {Analysis of ensemble forecasting strategies, which can provide a tangible backing for flood early warning procedures and mitigation measures over the Mediterranean region, is one of the fundamental motivations of the international HyMeX programme. Here, we examine two severe hydrometeorological episodes that affected the Milano urban area and for which the complex flood protection system of the city did not completely succeed. Indeed, flood damage have exponentially increased during the last 60 years, due to industrial and urban developments. Thus, the improvement of the Milano flood control system needs a synergism between structural and non-structural approaches. First, we examine how land-use changes due to urban development have altered the hydrological response to intense rainfalls. Second, we test a flood forecasting system which comprises the Flash-flood Event-based Spatially distributed rainfall-runoff Transformation, including Water Balance (FEST-WB) and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) models. Accurate forecasts of deep moist convection and extreme precipitation are difficult to be predicted due to uncertainties arising from the numeric weather prediction (NWP) physical parameterizations and high sensitivity to misrepresentation of the atmospheric state; however, two hydrological ensemble prediction systems (HEPS) have been designed to explicitly cope with uncertainties in the initial and lateral boundary conditions (IC/LBCs) and physical parameterizations of the NWP model. No substantial differences in skill have been found between both ensemble strategies when considering an enhanced diversity of IC/LBCs for the perturbed initial conditions ensemble. Furthermore, no additional benefits have been found by considering more frequent LBCs in a mixed physics ensemble, as ensemble spread seems to be reduced. These findings could help to design the most appropriate ensemble strategies before these hydrometeorological extremes, given the computational cost of running such advanced HEPSs for operational purposes.},

abstract = {Flash flood events are responsible for large economic losses and lead to fatalities every year in France. This is especially the case in the Mediterranean and oversea territories/departments of France, characterized by extreme hydro-climatological features and with a large part of the population exposed to flood risks. The recurrence of remarkable flash flood events, associated with high hazard intensity, significant damage and socio-political consequences, therefore raises several issues for authorities and risk management policies. This study aims to improve our understanding of the hazard analysis process in the case of four remarkable flood events: March 1930, October 1940, January 1980 and November 1999. Firstly, we present the methodology used to define the remarkability score of a flood event. Then, to identify the factors leading to a remarkable flood event, we explore the main parameters of the hazard analysis process, such as the meteorological triggering conditions, the return period of the rainfall and peak discharge, as well as some additional factors (initial catchment state, flood chronology, cascade effects, etc.). The results contribute to understanding the complexity of the processes leading to flood hazard and highlight the importance for risk managers of taking additional factors into account.},

abstract = {Baseflow is often considered to be the groundwater discharge component of streamflow. It is commonly estimated using conceptual models, recursive filters or a combination of the two. However, it is difficult to validate these methods due to the current challenges of measuring baseflow in the field. In this study, simulation of a synthetic catchment's response to rainfall is carried out using a fully integrated surface water-groundwater flow model. A series of rainfall events with differing recovery periods and varied antecedent moisture conditions is considered to span a range of different streamflow generation dynamics. Baseflow is estimated for the outlet hydrograph of the synthetic catchment using a selection of commonly used automated baseflow separation methods. These estimates are compared to the baseflow signal obtained from the numerical model, which serves as the control experiment. Results from these comparisons show that depending on the method used, automated baseflow separation underestimates the simulated baseflow by as much as 28{\%}, or overestimates it by up to 74{\%}, during rainfall events. No separation method is found to be clearly superior to the others, as the performance of the various methods varies with different soil types, antecedent moisture conditions and rainfall events. The differences between the various approaches clearly demonstrate that the baseflow separation methods investigated are not universally applicable. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to analyse the potential relationship between flash flood events and convective precipitation in Catalonia, as well as any related trends. The paper starts with an overview of flash floods and their trends in the Mediterranean region, along with their associated factors, followed by the definition of, identification of, and trends in convective precipitation. After this introduction the paper focuses on the north-eastern Iberian Peninsula, for which there is a long-term precipitation series (since 1928) of 1-min precipitation from the Fabra Observatory, as well as a shorter (1996???2011) but more extensive precipitation series (43 rain gauges) of 5-min precipitation. Both series have been used to characterise the degree of convective contribution to rainfall, introducing the ?? parameter as the ratio between convective precipitation versus total precipitation in any period. Information about flood events was obtained from the INUNGAMA database (a flood database created by the GAMA team), with the aim of finding any potential links to convective precipitation. These flood data were gathered using information on damage where flood is treated as a multifactorial risk, and where any trend or anomaly might have been caused by one or more factors affecting hazard, vulnerability or exposure. Trend analysis has shown an increase in flash flood events. The fact that no trends were detected in terms of extreme values of precipitation on a daily scale, nor on the associated ETCCDI (Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices) extreme index, could point to an increase in vulnerability, an increase in exposure, or changes in land use. However, the summer increase in convective precipitation was concentrated in less torrential events, which could partially explain this positive trend in flash flood events. The ?? parameter has been also used to characterise the type of flood event according to the features of the precipitation. The highest values correspond to short and local events, usually with daily ?? values above 0.5, while the minimum threshold of daily ?? for catastrophic flash floods is 0.31.},

abstract = {Hydrological distributed models demand large amounts of data, information and parameters in order to accurately represent the spatial variability of the main hydrological processes and inputs. The parameter estimation is always a complex and expensive task which is often unaffordable and therefore hydrologists are frequently forced to disregard distributed modelling in favour of lumped or semidistributed models. To solve this situation, we propose in this paper to split the effective parameter at each cell in two components: the hydrological characteristic (at point scale and maintaining its physical meaning) and a correction factor (common for all cells and taking into account all modelling errors including the temporal and spatial scale effects). The new split-parameter structure adopted in our distributed model (called TETIS) is coupled with the SCE-UA automatic optimization method in order to obtain the set of optimal correction factors of the model, without loosing the spatial variability described by the a priori estimated hydrological characteristics. Automatic procedures can be easily adapted to the split-parameter structure because the number of variables to be calibrated is dramatically reduced from thousands of cell parameters to a small number of common correction factors (one for each parameter map). Also, the optimum initial values of the state variables can be obtained automatically. In order to show the advantages of the new structure a real application is performed in a case study in which the calibration and the spatial and spatial-temporal validation processes have been carried out. The results can be considered as being excellent and it is concluded that automatic calibration with the SCE-UA algorithm has been shown to be reliable and fast. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Predictions in ungauged basins have been a major challenge in hydrologic sciences, and there is still much work needed to achieve robust and reliable predictions for such basins. Here, we propose and test a novel approach for predicting runoff from poorly gauged basins using a minimum complex model calibrated with isotope data alone (i.e., without observed discharge data). The model is composed of two water-stores (soil water and groundwater) and considers their connectivity to runoff in terms of both water and isotope budgets. In a meso-scale basin in which riverbed deformations frequently occur, making automatic observation of river discharge difficult, we measured hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition ($\delta$2H and $\delta$18O) of precipitation and river water twice-weekly for one year. Runoff predicted by the model agreed well with that observed monthly or bimonthly. Monte Carlo simulation revealed a strong coherence between model performance in isotope simulation and runoff prediction, demonstrating that the use of isotopes as dynamic proxies of calibration targets helps reliably constrain model parameters. Our results indicate that this approach can serve as a powerful tool for prediction of runoff hydrographs, particularly for basins in which the stage-discharge relationship is highly variable.},

@article{Zehe2008,
abstract = {In this paper we review threshold behaviour in environmental systems, which are often associated with the onset of floods, contamination and erosion events, and other degenerative processes. Key objectives of this review are to a) suggest indicators for detecting threshold behavior, b) discuss their implications for predictability, c) distinguish different forms of threshold behavior and their underlying controls, and d) hypothesise on possible reasons for why threshold behaviour might occur. Threshold behaviour involves a fast qualitative change of either a single process or the response of a system. For elementary phenomena this switch occurs when boundary conditions (e.g., energy inputs) or system states as expressed by dimensionless quantities (e.g. the Reynolds number) exceed threshold values. Mixing, water movement or depletion of thermodynamic gradients becomes much more efficient as a result. Intermittency is a very good indicator for detecting event scale threshold behavior in hydrological systems. Predictability of intermittent processes/system responses is inherently low for combinations of systems states and/or boundary conditions that push the system close to a threshold. Post hoc identification of `cause-effect relations' to explain when the system became critical is inherently difficult because of our limited ability to perform observations under controlled identical experimental conditions. In this review, we distinguish three forms of threshold behavior. The first one is threshold behavior at the process level that is controlled by the interplay of local soil characteristics and states, vegetation and the rainfall forcing. Overland flow formation, particle detachment and preferential flow are examples of this. The second form of threshold behaviour is the response of systems of intermediate complexity - e.g., catchment runoff response and sediment yield - governed by the redistribution of water and sediments in space and time. These are controlled by the topological architecture of the catchments that interacts with system states and the boundary conditions. Crossing the response thresholds means to establish connectedness of surface or subsurface flow paths to the catchment outlet. Subsurface stormflow in humid areas, overland flow and erosion in semi-arid and arid areas are examples, and explain that crossing local process thresholds is necessary but not sufficient to trigger a system response threshold. The third form of threshold behaviour involves changes in the `architecture' of human geo-ecosystems, which experience various disturbances. As a result substantial change in hydrological functioning of a system is induced, when the disturbances exceed the resilience of the geo-ecosystem. We present examples from savannah ecosystems, humid agricultural systems, mining activities affecting rainfall runoff in forested areas, badlands formation in Spain, and the restoration of the Upper Rhine river basin as examples of this phenomenon. This functional threshold behaviour is most difficult to predict, since it requires extrapolations far away from our usual experience and the accounting of bidirectional feedbacks. However, it does not require the development of more complicated model, but on the contrary, only models with the right level of simplification, which we illustrate with an instructive example. Following Prigogine, who studied structure formation in open thermodynamic systems, we hypothesise that topological structures which control response thresholds in the landscape might be seen as dissipative structures, nd the onset of threshold processes/response as a switch to more efficient ways of depleting strong gradients that develop in the case of extreme boundary conditions.},

abstract = {—As part of a long-range program on the hydrology of small watersheds, a corre­ lation between the two-year, one-hour rainfall intensity at 126 recording rainfall stations in northern California and related topographic and climatic parameters has been made. The re­ sulting correlation has a coefficient of correlation of 0.88 and a standard error of 0.067 inch/ hour. With this relation, it is possible to show the variation of rainfall intensity over the area in much greater detail than has hitherto been possible from observed intensity data alone. This paper discusses the parameters employed, the methods of correlation, and the results obtained. Introduction—One of the problems in any study of rainfall intensity is the limited number of stations with record suitable for frequency analy­ sis. For a regional study, data are limited to the hydrologic network stations available since about 1940. After preliminary study, it was decided to limit this analysis to California north of 35° N to avoid introducing large scale climatic factors. In this area approximately 150 station records were available for use. After screening to eliminate records which were too short or were composites from several station locations the number was reduced to 126. The maximum length of record was ten years and the average length substantially less. Conse­ quently the two-year, one hour intensity was adopted as the best choice of a dependent param­ eter. Since clock-hour data were readily avail­ able, these were used although the maximum 60-min values would be somewhat higher. Occasional summer thunderstdrms produce high-intensity rains in California. Because these storms are the result of quite different meterological processes, they were excluded from the analysis by using only the September through April period. Since most of these summer rains fall on dry ground and pro­ duce little runoff, this exclusion does not seem to affect the utility of the results. The general technique utilized is that previously employed by Spreen [1947] Burns [1952], and others for relating mean annual or mean seasonal pre­ cipitation to topography. The coaxial method of graphical correlation [Linsley and others, 1949] was employed because of the flexibility it offers. Since a relatively large number of stations was to be analyzed, data were transcribed onto Key sort punched cards. These cards could be easily strati­ fied and average values computed for each pa­ rameter as needed. The complete study [Linsley, 1956] involved comparison of four alternative relationships. This paper reports only the one which seems to offer the best results. Index daily rainfall—It is a logical assumption that, within a small region where the occurrence of rainfall at all stations is limited to about the same number of hours in a year, hourly intensities will bear some relation to mean annual precipita­ tion. The study area is too large for strict adherence to this assumption and a parameter called index daily rainfall was defined by},

abstract = {One of the main problems of flood hazard assessment in ungauged or poorly gauged basins is the lack of runoff data. In an attempt to overcome this problem we have combined archival records, dendrogeomorphic time series and instrumental data (daily rainfall and discharge) from four ungauged and poorly gauged mountain basins in Central Spain with the aim of reconstructing and compiling information on 41 flash flood events since the end of the 19th century. Estimation of historical discharge and the incorporation of uncertainty for the at-site and regional flood frequency analysis were performed with an empirical rainfall-runoff assessment as well as stochastic and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches. Results for each of the ungauged basins include flood frequency, severity, seasonality and triggers (synoptic meteorological situations). The reconstructed data series clearly demonstrates how uncertainty can be reduced by including historical information, but also points to the considerable influence of different approaches on quantile estimation. This uncertainty should be taken into account when these data are used for flood risk management. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This study documents the preferred location and diurnal cycle of extreme convective storms that occur in the tropical band containing the east Pacific Ocean, Central and South America, the Atlantic Ocean, and northern Africa. Data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar show three types of convective-stratiform structures that constitute extreme convective events: deep convective cores (DCCs), wide convective cores (WCCs), and broad stratiform regions (BSRs). Interim ECMWF Re- Analysis (ERA-Interim) data show the associated synoptic environmental factors associated with the oc- currence of extreme convective features. The DCC, WCC, and BSRechoes are associated with early, middle, and late stages of convective system development, respectively, and the statistics and timing of their occur- rence are related to topography and life cycle behavior of the convection. Storms containing DCC occur primarily over the Sudanian savannas of Africa and near the mountains in northern South America, being diurnally controlled. Storms with WCC manifest over land, in the same regions as the DCC, but also over oceanic regions. They appear around the clock but with maximum frequency at night. They are favored in regions of midlevel synoptic-scale low pressure systems, which over the sub-Sahara are the troughs of easterly waves. Storms containing BSR maximize over oceanic regions west of Africa and South America, where they exhibit a weak diurnal cycle with a slight midmorning maximum. Off the west coast of South America, the storms withWCCand BSR have longer lifetimes enhanced by orographic lifting over the Andes. The storms with BSR in the east Pacific Ocean often develop into tropical cyclones. 1.},

La simulaci�n adecuada de caudales en ocasiones esta desligada de la simulaci�n de variables hidr�ulicas del flujo las cuales son muy importantes para ciertas aplicaciones. La configuraci�n hidr�ulica de los cauces es un concepto que dif�cilmente puede ser descrito de manera puntual, mas bien es el producto de un conjunto de factores que est�n relacionados con las caracter�sticas longitudinales. En este trabajo se proponen algunas mejoras al componente hidr�ulico del modelo hidrol�gico SHIA propuesta por (V�lez, 2001) las cuales est�n basadas en la caracterizaci�n hidr�ulica de las corrientes por medio de tramos de configuraci�n t�pica y que pueden ser visualizados como un elemento de comportamiento similar en un contexto longitudinal y no puntual. Por otra parte, debido a que en ciertas aplicaciones no se cuenta con la informaci�n necesaria para la modelaci�n distribuida se propone una versi�n por laderas que esta ligada a la caracterizaci�n por tramos de corriente. Adicionalmente se presenta una metodolog�a para clasificar cada unidad de discretizaci�n espacial (celda) en base a la potencia especifica y el �rea de drenaje acumulada.

    abstract = { The International H2O Project (IHOP\_2002) is one of the largest North American meteorological field experiments in history. From 13 May to 25 June 2002, over 250 researchers and technical staff from the United States, Germany, France, and Canada converged on the Southern Great Plains to measure water vapor and other atmospheric variables. The principal objective of IHOP\_2002 is to obtain an improved characterization of the time-varying three-dimensional water vapor field and evaluate its utility in improving the understanding and prediction of convective processes. The motivation for this objective is the combination of extremely low forecast skill for warm-season rainfall and the relatively large loss of life and property from flash floods and other warm-season weather hazards. Many prior studies on convective storm forecasting have shown that water vapor is a key atmospheric variable that is insufficiently measured. Toward this goal, IHOP\_2002 brought together many of the existing operational and new state-of-the-art research water vapor sensors and numerical models. The IHOP\_2002 experiment comprised numerous unique aspects. These included several instruments fielded for the first time (e.g., reference radiosonde); numerous upgraded instruments (e.g., Wyoming Cloud Radar); the first ever horizontal-pointing water vapor differential absorption lidar (DIAL; i.e., Leandre II on the Naval Research Laboratory P-3), which required the first onboard aircraft avoidance radar; several unique combinations of sensors (e.g., multiple profiling instruments at one field site and the German water vapor DIAL and NOAA/Environmental Technology Laboratory Doppler lidar on board the German Falcon aircraft); and many logistical challenges. This article presents a summary of the motivation, goals, and experimental design of the project, illustrates some preliminary data collected, and includes discussion on some potential operational and research implications of the experiment. }

    abstract = { Abstract Flash flooding represents a significant hazard to human safety and a threat to property. Simulation and prediction of floods in complex urban settings requires high-resolution precipitation estimates and distributed hydrologic modeling. The need for reliable flash flood forecasting has increased in recent years, especially in urban communities, because of the high costs associated with flood occurrences. Several storm nowcast systems use radar to provide quantitative precipitation forecasts that can potentially afford great benefits to flood warning and short-term forecasting in urban settings. In this paper, the potential benefits of high-resolution weather radar data, physically based distributed hydrologic modeling, and quantitative precipitation nowcasting for urban hydrology and flash flood prediction were demonstrated by forcing a physically based distributed hydrologic model with precipitation forecasts made by a convective storm nowcast system to predict flash floods in a small, highly urbanized catchment in Denver, Colorado. Two rainfall events on 5 and 8 July 2001 in the Harvard Gulch watershed are presented that correspond to times during which the storm nowcast system was operated. Results clearly indicate that high-resolution radar-rainfall estimates and advanced nowcasting can potentially lead to improvements in flood warning and forecasting in urban watersheds, even for short-lived events on small catchments. At lead times of 70 min before the occurrence of peak discharge, forecast accuracies of approximately 17\% in peak discharge and 10 min in peak timing were achieved for a 10 km2 highly urbanized catchment. }

Abstract = {{In Mediterranean Europe, flash flooding is one of the most devastating
   hazards in terms of loss of human life and infrastructures. Over the
   last two decades, flash floods have caused damage costing a billion
   Euros in France alone. One of the problems of flash floods is that
   warning times are very short, leaving typically only a few hours for
   civil protection services to act. This study investigates if
   operationally available short-range numerical weather forecasts together
   with a rainfall-runoff model can be used for early indication of the
   occurrence of flash floods.
   One of the challenges in flash flood forecasting is that the watersheds
   are typically small, and good observational networks of both rainfall
   and discharge are rare. Therefore, hydrological models are difficult to
   calibrate and the simulated river discharges cannot always be compared
   with ground measurements. The lack of observations in most flash flood
   prone basins, therefore, necessitates the development of a method where
   the excess of the simulated discharge above a critical threshold can
   provide the forecaster with an indication of potential flood hazard in
   the area, with lead times of the order of weather forecasts.
   This study is focused on the Cevennes-Vivarais region in the Southeast
   of the Massif Central in France, a region known for devastating flash
   floods. This paper describes the main aspects of using numerical weather
   forecasting for flash flood forecasting, together with a threshold -
   exceedance. As a case study the severe flash flood event which took
   place on 8 - 9 September 2002 has been chosen.
   Short-range weather forecasts, from the Lokalmodell of the German
   national weather service, are used as input for the LISFLOOD model, a
   hybrid between a conceptual and physically based rainfall-runoff model.
   Results of the study indicate that high resolution operational weather
   forecasting combined with a rainfall-runoff model could be useful to
   determine flash floods more than 24 h in advance.}},

Abstract = {{Every year floods cause enormous damage all over the world. This study
   investigates loss of human life statistics for different types of floods
   and different regions on a global scale. The OFDA/CRED Database contains
   data on international disasters and is maintained by the Centre for
   Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters in Brussels (CRED) in
   cooperation with United States Office for Foreign Disaster Assistance
   (OFDA). Information from this source on a large number of flood events,
   which occurred between January 1975 and June 2002, is evaluated with
   respect to flood location and flood type. Due to the limited
   availability of information on coastal flood events, the scope of this
   study is limited to three types of freshwater flooding; river floods,
   flash floods and drainage problems. First, the development of loss of
   life statistics over time is discussed. Second, the dataset is analysed
   by region, by flood type and by the combination of type and region. The
   study shows that flash floods result in the highest average mortality
   per event (the number of fatalities divided by the number of affected
   persons). A cross analysis by flood type and location shows that average
   mortality is relatively constant for the different types over various
   continents, while the magnitude of the impacts (numbers of killed) and
   affected for a certain type varies between the different continents. On
   a worldwide scale Asian river floods are most significant in terms of
   number of persons killed and affected. Finally, a comparison with
   figures for other types of natural disasters shows that floods are the
   most significant disaster type in terms of the number of persons
   affected.}},

abstract = {The management of flash flood hazards and risks is a critical component of public safety and quality of life. Flash-floods develop at space and time scales that conventional observation systems are not able to monitor for rainfall and river discharge. Consequently, the atmospheric and hydrological generating mechanisms of flash-floods are poorly understood, leading to highly uncertain forecasts of these events. The objective of the HYDRATE project has been to improve the scientific basis of flash flood forecasting by advancing and harmonising a European-wide innovative flash flood observation strategy and developing a coherent set of technologies and tools for effective early warning systems. To this end, the project included actions on the organization of the existing flash flood data patrimony across Europe. The final aim of HYDRATE was to enhance the capability of flash flood forecasting in ungauged basins by exploiting the extended availability of flash flood data and the improved process understanding. This paper provides a review of the work conducted in HYDRATE with a special emphasis on how this body of research can contribute to guide the policy-life cycle concerning flash flood risk management. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The analysis of Henderson and Wooding, 1964, is expanded in comparing simplified models of subsurface stormflow for the case of a sloping soil mantle in which the hydraulic conductivity is constant throughout. Reviewing studies both in the field and theoretical in nature, the process of subsurface stormflow apparently will be the dominant mode of hydrological response of a hillslope or catchment under the following conditions: soils of high permeability, whether inherent in the soil matrix or due to structural or biotic macropores; and a steep hydraulic gradient, whether due to the slope of hillslopes or to the buildup of groundwater mounds on shallow slopes. The magnitude and timing of the subsurface flow response will depend on the depth and hydraulic conditions of the unsaturated zone at the time of the storm. In this paper only the simplest possible conditions have been studied, with the unsaturated zone being neglected, and constant input to a soil of constant hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity throughout its depth being assumed. It has been shown using data from field and numerical studies of subsurface stormflow that the kinematic approximation may be appropriate for combinations of slope conditions and input rates of practical interest.

abstract = {Methodologies for developing a macro-scale model of subsurface stormflow generation on a steep forested catchment in Japan are addressed. Field studies on this catchment have indicated that subsurface flow, consisting mainly of 'old' water displaced by 'new' rain water, dominates the storm response. Detailed field measurements on the catchment allowed simple, catchment-scale relationships to be developed between the volume of saturated groundwater, on the one hand, and discharge, and surface and subsurface saturated areas, on the other. Attempts are made to find linkages between these empirical relationships and physically-based descriptions of hydrological processes operating at smaller scales. A distributed model based on the saturated-unsaturated groundwater flow on steep catchments was developed and tested with field data collected on this catchment. Derivation of catchment-scale relationships can be carried out by a straightforward integration of the distributed model output. An alternative disaggregation-aggregation approach is presented, whereby the catchment is divided into a number of hillslope flow strips. By applying the distributed model on each flow strip, under steady-state conditions, it is possible to infer the spatial variability of groundwater volume in the various flow strips. This variability is related to a measure of hillslope topography and geometry. Knowing the catch-ment topography and geometry for any catchment, it is then possible to derive useful catchment-scale relationships which are applicable under quasi-steady-state conditions, Hydrological relationships derived in this manner are compared with corresponding empirical relationships. The methodologies presented are effective for understanding the linkages between catchment scale response and small-scale flow processes.},

abstract = {Mountainous headwaters include a variety of spatial landscape units; however, the flow contribution from different hydrologic components is complex and often unclear. In addition to complex landscape controls, temporal meteorological drivers play an important role in the distribution between surface runoff and subsurface storage changes. This spatiotemporal variability in partitioning can influence catchment-wide flow accumulation and nutrient and sediment loading. We use a multi-year, multi-method analysis of stable isotopes, geochemical indicators, and discharge distributed throughout the Haean catchment in South Korea to identify temporal variability in hydrologic flow partitioning from surface runoff, springs, shallow interflow, and groundwater under monsoonal conditions. By combining a weighted, multi-method discharge approach, high frequency, synoptic, catchment-wide isotopic and geochemical sampling, and baseflow analysis, we characterize watershed-scale spatiotemporal hydrologic flow partitioning. Meteorological drivers are spatially variable throughout the catchment and temporally between individual events. Baseflow contributions in the high elevation, forested areas are up to 50{\%}, while the majority of the catchment is approximately 20{\%}. Our study builds on previously reported seasonality of isotopic signatures by quantifying trends in distributed event-based partitioning of isotopic tracers. We demonstrate that high frequency flow partitioning can accurately be determined in mountainous topography with high precipitation and that there is a need for multiple method characterizations. Our results further show the benefit of spatially distributed synoptic sampling for process understanding of hydrologic partitioning throughout the watersheds.},

abstract = {This study examines the radar-indicated structures and other features of extreme rain events in the United States over a 3-yr period. A rainfall event is defined as “extreme” when the 24-h precipitation total at one or more stations surpasses the 50-yr recurrence interval amount for that location. This definition yields 116 such cases from 1999 to 2001 in the area east of the Rocky Mountains, excluding Florida. Two-kilometer national composite radar reflectivity data are then used to examine the structure and evolution of each extreme rain event. Sixty-five percent of the total number of events are associated with mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). While a wide variety of organizational structures (as indicated by radar reflectivity data) are seen among the MCS cases, two patterns of organization are observed most frequently. The first type has a line, often oriented east–west, with “training” convective elements. It also has a region of adjoining stratiform rain that is displaced to the north of the line. The second type has a back-building or quasi-stationary area of convection that produces a region of stratiform rain downstream. Surface observations and composite analysis of Rapid Update Cycle Version 2 (RUC-2) model data reveal that training line/adjoining stratiform (TL/AS) systems typically form in a very moist, unstable environment on the cool side of a preexisting slow-moving surface boundary. On the other hand, back-building/quasi-stationary (BB) MCSs are more dependent on mesoscale and storm-scale processes, particularly lifting provided by storm-generated cold pools, than on preexisting synoptic boundaries.},

Here, we conduct a coherent study of the full-scale of daily rainfall categories over a relatively large subtropical region- the Mediterranean- in order to assess whether this paradoxical behavior is real and its extent. We show that the torrential rainfall in Italy exceeding 128 mm/d has increased percentage-wise by a factor of 4 during 1951–1995 with strong peaks in El-Nino years. In Spain, extreme categories at both tails of the distribution (light: 0-4 mm/d and heavy/torrential: 64 mm/d and up) increased significantly. No significant trends were found in Israel and Cyprus. The consequent redistribution of the daily rainfall categories -torrential/heavy against the moderate/light intensities - is of utmost interest particularly in the semi-arid sub-tropical regions for purposes of water management, soil erosion and flash floods impacts.},

abstract = {This study examines the extent to which the floods in the Negev Desert, an area that constitutes the southern half of Israel, are not the outcome of purely local weather conditions but are, rather, the result of distinct synoptic-scale events. This was done through compiling and analysing a hydro-climatological database of all the major floods in the Negev, and then categorizing them manually into synoptic types that cause the major floods.The type analysis is based on the US National Meteorological Center data sets with 2.5° ׳ 2.5° resolution analysed by GrADS. Data were compiled and studied for 52 floods for the period 1965-94, with peak discharge above the magnitude of 5 year recurrence intervals (RI {\textgreater} 5 years) in at least one drainage basin.Distinct extreme synoptic patterns are indeed associated with 42 of the 52 floods. They were grouped into four synoptic types, two of which were associated with 37 events: (a) an active Red Sea trough, defined as a surface trough extending from East Africa through the Red Sea toward the eastern Mediterranean, accompanied by a pronounced trough at the 500 hPa level over eastern Egypt: (b) a Syrian low, defined as a well-developed Mediterranean cyclone accompanied by a pronounced upper-level trough, both located over Syria. Each of the four synoptic types has its own evolution course, and a unique seasonal and spatial distribution of its associated flooded basins.These findings imply that the major floods in the Negev can be considered as signatures of exceptional synoptic-scale evolutions, and that major floods reflect extreme climatic events. Our results indicate that it is possible to use a set of dynamic and thermodynamic variables for predicting the occurrence and location of major flash floods.

@article{Merz2003,
abstract = {We propose a framework for identifying types of causative mechanisms of floods. The types are long-rain floods, short-rain floods, flash floods, rain-on-snow floods, and snowmelt floods. We adopt a catchment perspective, i.e., the focus is on the catchment state and the atmospheric inputs rather than on atmospheric circulation patterns. We use a combination of a number of process indicators, including the timing of the floods, storm duration, rainfall depths, snowmelt, catchment state, runoff response dynamics, and spatial coherence. On the basis of these indicators and diagnostic regional plots we identify the process types of 11,518 maximum annual flood peaks in 490 Austrian catchments. Forty-three percent of the flood peaks are long-rain floods, only 3{\%} are snowmelt floods, and the relative contribution of the types changes with the flood magnitude. There are pronounced spatial patterns in the frequency of flood type occurrence. For example, rain-on-snow floods most commonly occur in northern Austria. Runoff coefficients tend to increase with rainfall depth for long-rain floods but are less dependent of rainfall depth and exhibit much larger scatter for flash floods. All types exhibit seasonal patterns, both in terms of flood magnitudes and catchment altitudes of flood occurrence. The coefficient of variation (CV) of the flood samples stratified by process type decreases with catchment area for most process types with the exception of flash floods for which CV increases with catchment area.},

abstract = {Within MAP, one of the scientific projects was devoted to ‘Boundary Layers in Complex Terrain'. In a number of subprojects, boundary-layer issues were addressed and detailed high-resolution multi-sensor observations were combined with simulation by models allowing for adequate parametrization of turbulence processes. In this contribution, the projects are briefly introduced and an attempt is made to summarize their key findings and to put them into a joint perspective. Spatial variability is found to be large but strictly related to topography and therefore allowing for possible parametrization. Traditional boundary-layer scaling approaches cannot simply be applied over highly complex topography, but some of the MAP findings suggest the potential for suitable extensions of those scaling relations to cover various cases of complex terrain. The mean boundary-layer structure and thermally driven flows in narrow valleys are found not to be generally in line with previous results from larger valleys elsewhere. Furthermore, local circulations are reported to contribute considerably to exchange between valley and free troposphere. In particular, the range of their effects on the lower atmosphere seems to be larger than just turbulent transport within the planetary boundary layer would suggest. Thus in larger-scale numerical models where the topography is not resolved, possible sub-grid parametrizations for local exchange seem to be in order.},

abstract = {CAPSULE A detailed overview of the uncharacteristic meteorological conditions that caused tropical-like, widespread, heavy rainfall and catastrophic flooding across the Colorado Front Range in September 2013. During the second week of September 2013 a seasonally-uncharacteristic weather pattern stalled over the Rocky Mountain Front Range region of northern Colorado bringing with it copious amounts of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea and the tropical Eastern Pacific Ocean. This feed of moisture was funneled towards the east facing mountain slopes by a series of mesoscale circulation features resulting in several days of unusually widespread heavy rainfall over steep mountainous terrain. Catastrophic flooding ensued within several Front Range river systems that washed away highways, destroyed towns, isolated communities, necessitated days of airborne evacuations, and resulted in eight fatalities (NWS, 2014). The impacts from heavy rainfall and flooding were felt over a broad region of northern Colorado leading to 18 counties being designated as federal disaster areas and resulting in damages exceeding {\$}2B. This study explores the meteorological and hydrological ingredients that led to this extreme event. After providing a basic timeline of events, synoptic and mesoscale circulation features of the event are discussed. Particular focus is placed on documenting how circulation features, embedded within the larger synoptic flow, served to funnel moist inflow into the mountain front driving several days of sustained orographic precipitation. Operational and research networks of polarimetric radar and surface instrumentation were used to evaluate the cloud structures and dominant hydrometeor characteristics. The performance of several quantitative precipitation estimates, quantitative precipitation forecasts, and hydrological forecast products are also analyzed with the intention of identifying what monitoring and prediction tools worked and where further improvements are needed.},

@article{Creutin2003a,
abstract = {Implementation of flood warning systems and community self-help programs is one of the most effective ways to mitigate the flash-flood risk. Inmany instances, these are the only affordable and sustainable mitigation approaches. Unfortunately, flash-flood warning is still hampered by changes in societal needs and by our limited knowledge of atmospheric and hydrologic generating mechanisms of this type of flood. On the one hand, flood warning has traditionally focused on localized targets for the protection of communities and for the management of hydraulic reservoirs. Given the general development of dispersed urbanization and transportation, and the expansion of green tourism and water sports in mountainous regions, human lives and property are increasingly exposed to flash-flood hazard in a scatteredmanner. This means that every river section of a monitored region can be considered as a potential target for flood warning. On the other hand, our poor knowledge of this phenomenon comes from the fact that, in most flash-flood cases, the rain accumulations and the discharges are simply unknown over most of the watersheds of concern. Flash floods develop at space and time scales that conventional observation systems of rain and discharge in rivers are not able to monitor. As these events are locally rare, they also escape the realm of field-based experimentation. Consequently, the atmospheric and hydrologic generating mechanisms of flash floods are poorly understood. Progress in flash-flood research is hampered by three main prob- lems: (i) the downscaling problem due to the incoherent space and time scales between atmospheric models and the flash-flood trigger- ing processes; (ii) the ungauged basin problem due to the fact that the small basins prone to flash-floods are seldom gauged and must be modelled without calibration; and (iii) the problem of knowing the limits of the soil retention control of runoff under the range of rain accumulations considered. Our view is that weather radar net- works deeply modify the flash flood monitoring problem. Combin- ing radar detection of rain and distributed hydrological modelling shows considerable potential for improving both the understanding of fundamental scientific questions, including extreme storms and runoff production mechanisms, and the ‘distributed' monitoring of the flash-flood hazard. This short commentary addresses some of these developments and identifies some new research needs in radar hydrology.},

abstract = {The soil water content is recognized as one of many runoff controlling factors in semiarid environments. A simple, physically based distributed model has been developed to study the role of antecedent soil water content in runoff generation in three small catchments in semiarid southeast Spain. The catchments were set up in two different zones: a burnt area with scarce vegetation and unburnt area with a denser plant cover. The infiltration process is determined by the Green-Ampt equation and the initial soil water content is taken into account by means of maps obtained by Conditional Gaussian simulation. The model was run 2700 times with different soil moisture scenarios and design storms. Stochastic sensitivity analysis was used to examine the role of antecedent soil water content in the runoff response. The results showed that the hydrological response after high intensity, low frequency storms is independent of the initial soil water content. On the other hand, the antecedent soil water content is an important factor controlling runoff during medium and low intensity storms, a type of rainstorm that is relatively frequent in semiarid areas. The sensitivity of the runoff response to soil moisture depended on the predominant runoff mechanisms. When infiltration excess overland flow is predominant, as a result of high rain intensities or less permeable soils, the runoff response is more uniform and does not depend on initial soil moisture. Runoff from less intense storms on soils of higher permeability is controlled by the soil water content of the surface soil layers and is more dependent on initial conditions. The role of the initial soil water content is more important in catchments where the presence of plant cover produces a patchwork of runoff and runon sites, whose spatial pattern is highly dependent on the soil water status. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In northern Morocco are located most of the dams and reservoirs of the country, while this region is affected by severe rainfall events causing floods. To improve the management of the water regulation structures, there is a need to develop rainfall-runoff models to both maximize the storage capacity and reduce the risks caused by floods. In this study, a model is developed to reproduce the flood events for a 655 km2 catchment located upstream of the 6th largest dam in Morocco. Constrained by data availability, a standard event-based model combining a SCS-CN (Soil Conservation Service Curve Number) loss model and a Clark unit hydrograph was developed for hourly discharge simulation using 16 flood events that occurred between 1984 and 2008. The model was found satisfactory to reproduce the runoff and the temporal evolution of floods, even with limited rainfall data. Several antecedent wetness conditions estimators for the catchment were compared with the initial condition of the model. Theses estimators include an antecedent discharge index, an antecedent precipitation index and a continuous daily soil moisture accounting model (SMA), based on precipitation and evapotranspiration. The SMA model performed the best to estimate the initial conditions of the event-based hydrological model (R2 Combining double low line 0.9). Its daily output has been compared with ASCAT and AMSR-E remote sensing data products, which were both able to reproduce with accuracy the daily simulated soil moisture dynamics at the catchment scale. This same approach could be implemented in other catchments of this region for operational purposes. The Results of this study suggest that remote sensing data are potentially useful to estimate the soil moisture conditions in the case of ungauged catchments in Northern Africa. {\textcopyright} 2012 Author(s).},

@article{Martin2018,
abstract = {The 1962 Rub{\'{i}} flood was a severe flash flood, the worst to ever take place in Spain, claiming the lives of more than 800 people following 200 mm of rainfall in 2 h. Such a high number of casualties can be explained by the very high vulnerability of people who lived in the floodplains of a wandering, ephemeral stream (a wadi) prone to flash floods. Many publications to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the flood have been used as proxy data for the event, especially in terms of social aspects. The meteorological and pluviometric information is reviewed, while other information is only found in grey literature. Recently, the event has been considered an outlier in the panorama of European flash floods. Because of the above, this paper aims to convey all the information to readers and show that it deserves to be raised to an international level as an example of an extreme flash flood. After addressing some misunderstandings, it can be concluded that the event was not an outlier, nor was it extreme, in terms of total rainfall, return period, discharge, discharge per unit basin area, unit stream power and flow velocity. It may be extraordinary because the flood reached very high levels by transporting large amounts of both fine and coarse sediment particles. The stream is steep, ephemeral, lacking an armour layer, and prone to torrential events, in which the large sediment transport played a role in how high the flood levels rose. The use of flooding marks to compute discharges is also discussed. In addition, the paper presents a torrential calculation based on the momentum principle in a control volume.},

abstract = {Floods are one of the most damaging natural hazards causing huge loss of property, infrastructure and lives. Prediction of occurrence of flash flood locations is very difficult due to sudden change in climatic condition and manmade factors. However, prior identification of flood susceptible areas can be done with the help of machine learning techniques for proper timely management of flood hazards. In this study, we tested four decision trees based machine learning models namely Logistic Model Trees (LMT), Reduced Error Pruning Trees (REPT), Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes Trees (NBT), and Alternating Decision Trees (ADT) for flash flood susceptibility mapping at the Haraz Watershed in the northern part of Iran. For this, a spatial database was constructed with 201 present and past flood locations and eleven flood-influencing factors namely ground slope, altitude, curvature, Stream Power Index (SPI), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), land use, rainfall, river density, distance from river, lithology, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Statistical evaluation measures, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, and Freidman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to validate and compare the prediction capability of the models. Results show that the ADT model has the highest prediction capability for flash flood susceptibility assessment, followed by the NBT, the LMT, and the REPT, respectively. These techniques have proven successful in quickly determining flood susceptible areas.},

@article{Bisht2018,
abstract = {Himachal Pradesh is in the western part of the Indian Himalaya which is environmentally fragile and susceptible to natural disasters. Flash flood disaster is a major problem in the state due to its diverse topography combined with meteorological and morphological conditions. In the present study, detailed terrain information was used to identify the causes of natural disaster. Remote Sensing data such as Landsat 8 satellite data and ASTER (DEM) coupled with geological and geomorphological data were utilized in a Geographical Information System (GIS) environment for the estimation of flash flood risk in 20 sub-watersheds of Beas valley. Morphometric analysis was used to estimate the flash flood risk levels of sub-watersheds. Drainage characteristics, slope, and wetness index were analyzed by a set of parameters relevant to flash flood risks. All the sub-watersheds were assigned with a rank according to the compound value analyzed for all the given parameters. After analysis of compound values, it was observed that an area of 555 km2which is 47{\%} of the total area was in very high priority and very highly susceptible to the flash flood occurrences. In the entire watershed, more than 90{\%} of the total area was found to be highly vulnerable to flash floods. Such zonations using RS/GIS can assist policymakers in taking appropriate and timely measures for the reduction of flash floods. This can initiate appropriate corrective measures and reduce the risk of heavy loss of life and property.},

@article{Marchi2016,
abstract = {Flash floods are characterized by strong spatial gradients of rainfall inputs that hit different parts of a river basin with different intensity. Stream power values associated with flash floods therefore show spatial variations that depend on geological controls on channel geometry and sediment characteristics, as well as on the variations of flood intensity: this stresses the need for a field approach that takes into account the variability of the controlling factors. Post-flood assessment of peak discharge after major floods makes it possible to analyse stream power in fluvial systems affected by flash floods. This study analyses the stream power of seven intense (return period of rainfall {\textgreater} 100 years at least in some sectors of the river basin) flash floods that occurred in mountainous basins of central and southern Europe from 2007 to 2014. In most of the analysed cross sections, high values of unit stream power were observed; this is consistent with the high severity of the studied floods. The highest values of cross-sectional stream power and unit stream power usually occur in Mediterranean regions. This is mainly ascribed to the larger peak discharges that characterize flash floods in these regions. The variability of unit stream power with catchment area is clearly nonlinear and has been represented by log-quadratic relations. The values of catchment area at which maximum values of unit stream power occur show relevant differences among the studied floods and are linked to the spatial scale of the events. Values of stream power are generally consistent with observed geomorphic changes in the studied cross sections: bedrock channels show the highest values of unit stream power but no visible erosion, whereas major erosion has been observed in alluvial channels. Exceptions to this general pattern, which mostly occur in semi-alluvial cross sections, urge the recognition of local or event-specific conditions that increase the resistance of channel bed and banks to erosion or, like short flow duration, reduce the geomorphic effectiveness of the flood.},

    abstract = { Abstract Raindrop images obtained on research flights of the NCAR Electra aircraft in the Tropical Oceans Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) are analyzed. The drop size distributions, based on the images obtained in 6-s samples (about 750 m of flight track), are used to calculate both radar reflectivity Z and rain rate R. Airborne radar data from the NOAA P-3 aircraft flying in coordination with the Electra are used to categorize the particle-image data according to whether the drop images were obtained in regions of convective or stratiform precipitation. Within stratiform precipitation, the same rain rate could be produced by a drop spectrum dominated by numerous small drops (lower reflectivity) or by a few large drops (higher reflectivity). The reflectivity values varied by as much as 9 dB for a given rain rate. Reflectivity data from the airborne radar and flight-level data reveal that the stratiform regions often contain fallstreaks of about 0.1–2 km in horizontal dimension. The fallstreaks are associated with large-drop spectra and local maxima in reflectivity up to approximately 40 dBZ and in rain rates up to 25 mm h−1. The fallstreaks extend downward from the melting band and bend with the low-level wind shear, but do not usually reach the surface. Thus, although relatively more uniform than convective regions, stratiform regions can be variable in reflectivity and rain rate at fine spatial scales in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Stratiform regions are therefore best characterized by their ensemble properties rather than the values of individual high-resolution measurements. The variability of stratiform drop size spectra arises primarily from the occurrence of fallstreaks and the discontinuous nature of regions favoring aggregation of snow crystals, and it implies that Z–R distributions associated with convective and stratiform precipitation are not statistically distinct. Thus, separate Z–R relations for convective and stratiform precipitation are not justified, and techniques to distinguish between convective and stratiform precipitation based solely on the characteristics of drop size distributions are not likely to be accurate. The variability of the drop size spectra in tropical precipitation makes an exponential fit to the Z–R relation sensitive to the spatial scale over which Z and R are determined. This sensitivity can be avoided by using a probability-matched Z–R relation. The probability-matched Z–R relation for all the raindrop image data from the Electra collected between altitudes of 2.7 and 3.3 km in TOGA COARE is similar to the Z–R relation obtained at the sea surface in the Global Atmospheric Research Program Atlantic Tropical Experiment. }
